COMPANY OVERVIEW - WHO WE ARE
=======================================================================

The Block Audit LLC
Phone: 954-698-2700
Website: www.theblockaudit.com
Email: info@theblockaudit.com

The Block Audit LLC was created by active police economic crimes detectives as a way to collaborate and share lessons learned with other law enforcement and financial investigations professionals to aid in combatting the swift adoption of cryptocurrency focused tactics into traditional financial crimes cases.

OUR MOTIVATION
While attempting to stay abreast of the latest trends in financial crimes, and respond to the growing cryptocurrency related case load, we sought any relevant training. Unfortunately, there was not much available concerning how to investigate or trace cryptocurrencies. This sparked a journey that continues till this day to locate resources, decipher criminal tactics, and connect with industry experts to stay up to date with an everchanging and evolving crime trend.

We quickly learned however, that our "favorite tabs" in our internet browser was running out of space, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to organize the useful sites we were locating to assist in open-source crypto investigations. This prompted us to create www.theblockaudit.com where we could host all of these links in an organized manner, not only for our own use, but to share with other investigators who would soon be facing the same issues.

OUR VISION
Equip every citizen with access to expert knowledge, experience and forensic tools in the fight against crypto facilitated crimes through partnership with law enforcement and financial investigative professionals.

WHAT WE OFFER:

Open Source Resources
Our Investigators Hub is open for anyone to use. It is a curated collection of all open source block explorers and other crypto related sites we have found to be useful in conducting real investigations. We have organized them by subject into an easy to navigate menu. Whether you are attempting to trace assets, locate crypto kiosks in your area, identify historical crypto prices, or find an efficient way to chart a graph for presentation, you will find useful links here.

Legal Service Guide
The legal landscape of crypto investigations changes by the day. Which exchanges are willing to cooperate with law enforcement and what they require in the form of legal process is a never ending struggle to keep up with. We harness our own experience and the experiences of our members to provide an updated list of where, and how to serve legal process. We also provide templates and examples to assist in your investigations.

Community of Experts
For any individual person to claim status as a "crypto expert" is a mistake when you are in a field that is constantly changing. The expertise you may have today can be completely wiped out tomorrow by a shift in this rapidly changing industry. The only way to develop true expertise is through wide collaboration in an environment where we can continuously learn from one another in this developing field. That is why we have created forums and communication channels where we as practitioners can share lessons learned and stay abreast of the latest developments in a secure area.

Consulting and Blockchain Forensics
While we have taken great lengths to provide the information and tools your agency needs to be successful as a free resource, we know not everyone will have the will, resources, or manpower to dedicate to this task.

We offer a scalable turn-key solution for any entity wanting to address crypto facilitated crimes without dedicating the time, manpower, and training necessary to stand up a new unit.

For an annual subscription fee, The Block Audit will consult on policy creation, asset custody considerations, and development of investigative work flows. We will also assign dedicated Blockchain Forensic Examiners to conduct the trace of assets using our own forensic tool licenses to progress criminal investigations toward the goal of case closures, victim asset recovery and/or asset forfeiture.

Training
We offer various levels of training from introductory webinars to our full 40 hour Crypto Investigators Academy. We can also develop custom courses to meet your needs. Hosting agencies will receive free seats to training.

=======================================================================
GLOSSARY OF TERMS
=======================================================================

Adjusted Root Total (ART): The root minus any documented write-offs. This becomes the accounting baseline that all threads must sum to at each hop level for mathematical validation.

Back Tracing: The investigative technique of working backward from known criminal infrastructure or terminal wallets to identify additional victims or funding sources. When performed during Level 3 or 4 investigations, back tracing functions as Level 1 discovery - prioritizing speed and lead generation over detailed documentation.

Block Audit Tracing Standard (B.A.T.S.): A standardized framework for cryptocurrency investigation that maintains the golden thread of traceability required for successful asset forfeiture cases through systematic color classification, hierarchical notation, and accounting validation.

Cluster Analysis: Examines relationships and patterns across multiple addresses without focusing on specific transaction flows, identifying relationships through behavioral patterns revealing common ownership.

Commingling: When traced criminal proceeds mix with existing wallet balances or other fund sources, requiring careful application of PIFO principles to maintain the golden thread. Courts have established that commingling does not cleanse tainted funds.

Convergence: When multiple trace paths arrive at the same wallet and subsequently move out together as a single transaction. Requires application of the Sequential Hop Rule.

Exchange Deposit Addresses: Wallets where the on-chain trail terminates and legal process becomes necessary to continue tracing. Classified as PURPLE wallets in B.A.T.S.

Golden Thread: The unbroken connection between a victim's original funds and any assets ultimately seized by law enforcement, essential for proving direct traceability in asset forfeiture cases. This principle aligns with judicial standards that examine direct connections between assets and criminal activity.

High-Risk Customer: A customer or wallet identified through risk assessment procedures as presenting elevated money laundering or terrorist financing risk based on factors such as transaction patterns, geographic exposure, or business type.

Hop Count: The measurement of distance from the victim-facing wallet rather than chronological discovery order. Each blockchain transaction increments the hop count by one.

Hub Wallets: Wallets where multiple victim traces converge, proving common criminal control. Classified as YELLOW wallets and crucial for linking separate criminal operations.

LIBR Method (Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule): Traditional asset tracing principle applicable to cryptocurrency investigations that tracks the lowest balance point in an account to determine maximum traceable amounts. Has the effect of holding tracible assets to fewer hops.

Matching Transactions Principle (MTP): An exception to strict PIFO methodology when outgoing transactions precisely match incoming thread totals in amount and occur in close temporal proximity.

Off-Ramping: The process by which criminals convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency or other assets, typically through exchanges.

On-Ramping: The process by which stolen funds initially enter the criminal cryptocurrency infrastructure.

PIFO Method: (Proceeds In First Out) - the principle that when traced funds enter a wallet, the very next outbound transaction contains those funds, applied chronologically. This method is often mischaracterized as first-in-first-out, but PIFO works fundamentally different as the practice of following "dirty" funds does not reset upon each subsequent deposit to the wallet, and PIFO is grounded in its own specific case law; not inventory accounting methods.

Red Wallet Index: The formal inventory of all victim-facing wallets (RED wallets) identified in an investigation, with each assigned a permanent identifier (R1, R2, R3, etc.).

Root: The original amount of a victim's transaction that forms the baseline for all subsequent tracing.

Root Validation: The mathematical verification process ensuring that all thread totals at any given hop level sum to the adjusted root total, providing proof of investigation completeness and preventing scope creep.

Sequential Hop Rule: The rule for handling convergence by applying the highest hop count among all converging paths, plus one for the outbound transaction.

Thread: The specific amount being traced through a particular transaction path at any given hop level.

Thread Exposure: The percentage of a wallet's total balance comprised of traced criminal proceeds.

Travel Rule: Regulatory requirement mandating that VASPs collect and transmit specific originator and beneficiary information for cryptocurrency transfers exceeding designated thresholds.

Universal Wallet Index (UWI): A comprehensive index of all wallets involved in the money laundering process.

V-T-H Notation: The standardized identification system where V represents victim number, T represents transaction number, and H represents hop count from the victim-facing wallet.

V-T Notation: The standardized identification system used in B.A.T.S. 3 where V represents victim number, T represents transaction number.

Victim Facing Wallets: The first wallets to receive stolen funds where criminal acts are initiated. Classified as RED wallets and serving as the starting point for all hop counting.

Write-off: Documented abandonment of trace paths for practical reasons including dust amounts, dilution, obfuscation, or operational constraints.

WALLET CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
=======================================================================

Before diving into the specific levels, it's essential to understand the wallet classification system used throughout the B.A.T.S method. This color-coding system transforms complex wallet analysis into immediately recognizable categories:

RED wallets: Victim facing wallets – the first destination for stolen funds where the criminal act is initiated. These wallets provide undeniable evidence of criminal activity and serve as the starting point for all hop counting.

PINK wallets: Dividend and deception operations where fake returns are sent to victims in investment scams. PINK classification provides undeniable proof of criminal intent and serve to implicate all black wallets between them and the red wallets as part of the criminal network.

YELLOW wallets: Hub wallets where multiple victim traces converge. This convergence proves common criminal control and also serve to tie in any black wallets occurring between them and the initial red wallets as participating in the criminal network.

ORANGE wallets: Bitcoin change addresses essential for UTXO tracing.

BROWN wallets: Handle asset conversion where cryptocurrency types change via bridges, decentralized exchanges, or DApps. These are on-chain services where the color-coded indicator can be used to note changes in assets without need to plot complex smart contract call asset flows.

BLACK wallets: Default classification for intermediary wallets with no direct victim exposure.

BLUE wallets: Cold storage – wallets currently holding traced assets. This is a temporary classification used to pause tracing at a specific point to await further movement or note aggregation of funds in a criminal network.

PURPLE wallets: Exchange deposit addresses where the on-chain trail terminates. These points indicate the need for legal process to obtain records to pursue the trace, identify suspects, or seize assets.

GRAY wallets: Obfuscated or diluted traces where the path has become effectively untraceable. This classification is used to visually note the location where portions of the traced assets were abandoned.

GREEN wallets: Victim-owned addresses that remain under victim custody or control.

WALLET CLASSIFICATION QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE

• Victim Facing - First destination for stolen funds - Starting point
• Dividend/Deception - Fake returns in scams - Proves intent
• Hub Wallet - Multiple victims converge - Common control
• Bitcoin Change - UTXO change addresses - Not new wallets
• Asset Conversion - Bridges, DEXs, DApps - Track conversions
• Default Intermediary - No significance unless patterns show criminal control
• Cold Storage - Currently holding assets - Temporary status
• Exchange Deposit - Trail ends - Need legal process
• Obfuscated/Diluted - Mixers, privacy coins - Write-offs
• Victim Owned - Under victim control - Exclude from analysis

Remember:
• RED always starts hop count
• YELLOW proves control
• PURPLE needs subpoenas
• GRAY requires write-offs

B.A.T.S. INTRODUCTION: DEFINING THE INVESTIGATIVE APPROACH
=======================================================================

Dual Purpose Framework
The B.A.T.S. framework serves both criminal investigators and AML/CTF professionals, providing a standardized methodology that scales from rapid suspicious activity assessment to meticulous asset forfeiture documentation. This universality emerges from a fundamental principle: both groups are measuring "distance from bad" - whether that starting point is a victim's stolen funds, a known terrorist funding source, or a sanctioned entity's wallet.

Cryptocurrency investigations serve different purposes that require varying levels of precision and documentation. Sometimes you need to quickly assess if a case is worth pursuing. Other times you're building evidence that must survive courtroom scrutiny. At the highest level, you need mathematical precision to support the seizure or forfeiture of cryptocurrency assets.

The key is matching your approach to your goals. Using detailed methodology when you just need leads wastes time. Using shortcuts when you need court-ready evidence can destroy your case. Using Level 3 evidence standards when you need to seize assets can result in successful criminal prosecutions but failed asset recovery - meaning victims don't get compensated and criminals keep their proceeds.

This guide presents a comprehensive framework that scales from quick discovery to rigorous mathematical analysis. Understanding when to use each approach makes your investigations more efficient and successful, while at the highest level, the Block Audit Tracing Standard (B.A.T.S.) provides the mathematical precision required for asset forfeiture cases.

Choosing the Right Approach: Decision Framework

Start with Your Goals
The most important factor in choosing your approach is understanding what you're trying to accomplish: Triage, intelligence gathering, prosecution case preparation, or asset forfeiture.

Consider Your Resources
Different approaches require different time investments:
• Limited time or multiple cases? Level 1 gives you the most information quickly.
• Adequate resources for thorough analysis? Higher levels provide more comprehensive results.
• Specialized cryptocurrency expertise available? Level 3 and 4 approaches become more feasible.

Think About Legal Requirements
Your legal objectives determine your minimum documentation standards:
• Asset seizure planned? Level 4 mathematical precision is required.
• Search warrants needed? Level 3 case preparation is the minimum.
• Intelligence product sufficient? Level 1 or 2 analysis may be adequate.

Plan for Case Evolution
Many cases start at one level and evolve to require higher levels of analysis. A case might begin as Level 1 discovery to assess scope, develop into Level 2 intelligence development as patterns emerge, progress to Level 3 case preparation when suspects are identified, and finally require Level 4 asset forfeiture analysis when seizure opportunities arise.

Design your documentation to support this evolution. Even during initial discovery, maintain standards that will allow you to escalate your analysis if circumstances change. The wallet numbering system must remain stable and permanent once established in Level 2 - wallet IDs assigned never change when transitioning between levels.

B.A.T.S. CORE PRINCIPLES
=======================================================================

The Block Audit Tracing Standard (B.A.T.S.) Core Principles

The Block Audit Tracing Standard (B.A.T.S.) represents a revolutionary approach to cryptocurrency investigation that addresses the most critical challenge facing virtual asset forensics: maintaining the golden thread of traceability required for successful asset forfeiture cases.

1. The Golden Thread Principle
Maintain an unbroken connection between a victim's original funds and any assets ultimately seized by law enforcement. Courts demand proof that seized cryptocurrency originated from criminal activity, not legitimate sources.

2. Mathematical Precision
Prove that specific cryptocurrency in seized wallets came from specific criminal acts with mathematical certainty. All threads at any hop level must sum to the adjusted root total.

3. Scope Control
Avoid scope creep by maintaining strict accounting rules and focused methodology on traced assets. Scope creep transforms manageable cases into unwieldy analyses.

4. Pattern Recognition & Network Control
Use intelligence and behavioral analysis to prove the laundering network maintains control (dirty wallet principle). Holistic view proves assets remain in laundering process.

5. Documentation & Audit Trail
Maintain detailed documentation enabling independent verification with narrative explanations of all decisions. Every decision documented = reproducible investigation.

Methodology Foundation
• PIFO: Proceeds In First Out - chronological tracking
• V-T-H Notation: Victim-Transaction-Hop counting
• Wallet Classification: Color-coded system (RED, YELLOW, etc.)
• Root Validation: Mathematical completeness checks

The Golden Thread Principle: B.A.T.S. maintains that investigators must be able to prove a direct, unbroken connection between a victim's original funds and any assets ultimately seized by law enforcement. This principle addresses the fundamental legal requirement in asset forfeiture cases, where courts demand evidence that specific seized cryptocurrency originated from criminal activity rather than legitimate sources.

Mathematical Precision Requirements: Asset forfeiture requires mathematical certainty. You must be able to prove that specific dollars in seized wallets came from specific criminal acts. This isn't just following money from point A to point B - it's maintaining an unbroken mathematical connection through complex money laundering schemes.

Scope Control: The golden thread concept becomes particularly crucial when dealing with commingling, where criminal proceeds mix with existing wallet balances or other fund sources. Without rigorous methodology for tracking specific portions of commingled funds, investigations risk exponential scope creep. B.A.T.S. prevents this expansion through strict accounting rules that maintain focus on the original root total while providing mathematical validation of investigative completeness.

The Dirty Wallet Principle: When cryptocurrency wallets demonstrate systematic patterns of receiving funds from multiple criminal sources, this behavioral evidence may support expanded legal theories beyond traced amounts. The 'dirty wallet' principle recognizes that wallets showing these patterns of use may become instrumentalities to the crime in and of themselves, which may allow different legal treatment than wallets with incidental exposure. To prevent uncontrolled scope creep this principle should be reserved for terminal wallets potentially exposing entire wallet balances to seizure/forfeiture. B.A.T.S. documentation captures these behavioral patterns to support whatever legal theories prosecutors may pursue.

PIFO Method and Transaction Flow Principles
The cornerstone of B.A.T.S.'s transaction tracing methodology is the PIFO method - Proceeds In First Out. This principle maintains that when traced funds enter a wallet, the very next outbound transaction contains those funds. PIFO operates on strict chronological order, where the first proceeds to arrive are literally the first proceeds to leave.

PIFO provides the legal foundation for maintaining the golden thread through commingling scenarios. When a wallet contains both traced criminal proceeds and existing legitimate funds, PIFO enables investigators to follow the specific criminal proceeds without expanding scope to include the entire wallet balance.

The Scope Creep Problem: How Commingling Destroys Investigations
Treating all commingled funds as tainted creates exponential expansion

WRONG: Scope Creep Through Commingling
Victim: $100
Criminal Wallet A: $100 (stolen) + $900 (existing) = $1,000
Treating all as tainted
Must now track $1,000 to:
Wallet B: $300, Wallet C: $200, Wallet D: $400, Wallet E: $100
Each wallet has its own balance...
Investigation Scope: $100 → $4,000 → $16,000 → ∞

RIGHT: Controlled Thread Tracing
Victim: $100
Criminal Wallet A: Track $100 only (ignore $900)
Criminal Wallet B: $100 thread maintained
Criminal Wallet C: $100 thread maintained
Exchange Account (Terminal Point): Balance: $500,000 - ALL potentially forfeitable
Traced: $100 → Potential Forfeiture: $500,000
Entire account within reach via dirty wallet principle

Core Principle: Mathematical Precision Over Scope Expansion
The "dirty wallet" principle is a powerful legal doctrine applied ONLY at terminal points (exchanges) after establishing direct traceability. Using it as a tracing methodology creates exponential scope creep and destroys the mathematical foundation required for asset forfeiture.

Matching Transactions Principle (MTP)
B.A.T.S. recognizes that strict PIFO application may occasionally miss obvious criminal intent when specific amounts create clear patterns. The Matching Transactions Principle provides a rare exception to PIFO methodology when outgoing transactions precisely match incoming thread totals in amount and occur in close temporal proximity.

For example, if a thread total of $34,509 enters a wallet, and while strict PIFO would follow a subsequent $100,000 outbound transaction, investigators may opt to follow a later $34,509 outbound transaction if the amount specificity suggests intentional movement of those exact assets. This deviation requires documentation and narrative justification. This process does not apply the same way in UTXO blockchains where specific UTXOs in a wallet will always have matching outbound UTXOs to a transaction.

The Commingling Challenge and Scope Management
When criminal proceeds mix with legitimate funds, investigators face complex questions about which portions of subsequent transactions represent traceable criminal activity. Legal principles recognize that wallets used for money laundering may expose their entire contents to forfeiture. However, automatic application of this principle creates dangerous scope creep.

Consider tracing $100 in criminal proceeds entering a wallet containing $100 in legitimate funds. Treating the entire $200 as "dirty" and following $1 payments to 200 different wallets suddenly expands the investigation to $20,000 across 200 addresses. This exponential growth pattern can transform manageable investigations into unwieldy analyses involving thousands of addresses far removed from original criminal activity.

Effective scope management requires applying commingling principles with focused direction and clear legal justification. Consider the wallet's primary purpose, the proportion of criminal versus legitimate funds, evidence of intentional laundering versus incidental mixing, and practical constraints.

Documentation becomes crucial when applying commingling theories. Distinguish between amounts directly traceable to criminal activity and amounts included through commingling arguments. This transparency enables legal review and prevents overreach accusations. The commingling (dirty wallet) principle should be applied at terminal points after mathematical tracing establishes criminal connections, not as a methodology to expand scope during analysis.

The Treasure-Hunting Problem: A critical ethical issue emerges when investigators use broad scope expansion to locate large cryptocurrency holdings rather than following specific evidence. This approach inverts proper methodology—identifying "treasure" first, then constructing arguments to connect it to the case. Such approaches undermine the mathematical precision that gives cryptocurrency investigations legal credibility and represent overreach that courts may reject.

=======================================================================
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
=======================================================================

The field of cryptocurrency investigation operates within a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape where legal precedents continue to develop and established frameworks often lag behind technological capabilities. This dynamic environment creates both unprecedented investigative opportunities and significant professional responsibilities.

Fundamental Professional Obligations
Cryptocurrency investigators bear multiple competing but equally essential responsibilities that must be balanced throughout every investigation. The protection of the financial system represents a foundational obligation that recognizes cryptocurrency's role in the broader economy. Investigators serve as guardians against criminal exploitation while helping demonstrate that these technologies can operate safely within established legal frameworks.

Simultaneously, investigators carry responsibility to hold criminal actors accountable through thorough, accurate analysis that supports successful prosecutions. The technical complexity of cryptocurrency investigations magnifies the importance of this responsibility, as analytical errors or methodological shortcomings can undermine entire prosecutions.

The support of victim asset recovery represents another crucial obligation that acknowledges the human cost of cryptocurrency crimes. However, these obligations must be balanced against equally important responsibilities to avoid investigative overreach and prevent abuse of asset forfeiture laws.

The Precedent Development Challenge
The current regulatory environment can be characterized as a period of rapid development where many fundamental questions remain unresolved. This regulatory uncertainty presents both opportunities and dangers for cryptocurrency investigators. The absence of restrictive precedents may enable creative analytical approaches, but this apparent freedom carries significant risks.

Overly aggressive or questionable investigative techniques may ultimately prompt restrictive regulatory responses that limit future investigative capabilities. Court decisions establishing precedents for cryptocurrency investigations often result from cases where investigative techniques face legal challenges. Investigators who employ questionable methods risk creating unfavorable case law that restricts future investigations.

Professional Standards and Sustainable Practices
The development of sustainable cryptocurrency investigation practices requires conscious attention to professional standards that promote effective law enforcement while preserving individual rights and maintaining public trust.

Proportionality requires matching investigative intensity to the severity of suspected criminal activity and the strength of available evidence. Transparency in methodology builds credibility and supports legal review of investigative findings. Scope discipline requires investigators to resist expanding investigations simply because technological tools make broader analysis possible.

The maintenance of professional standards equivalent to those applied in traditional financial investigations ensures that technological complexity does not justify relaxed ethical obligations.

Building Long-Term Credibility
The ultimate goal of professional cryptocurrency investigation is developing practices that remain effective, legally defensible, and sustainable over the long term. Continuous professional development ensures investigators remain informed about evolving standards. Active participation in professional organizations enables contribution to responsible standards development.

The cryptocurrency investigation field will be fundamentally shaped by the choices that current practitioners make today regarding professional standards and ethical constraints. By exercising appropriate restraint, maintaining high professional standards, and considering long-term implications of investigative techniques, practitioners can help ensure that powerful legal tools for asset recovery remain available for legitimate law enforcement purposes.

UTXO Tracing Considerations for Bitcoin Investigations
Bitcoin's UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model requires specific consideration in asset tracing methodology that differs from account-based cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. While UTXOs are technically distinguishable, Bitcoin remains fungible—each satoshi is as valuable and interchangeable as any other, similar to how serialized dollar bills remain fungible currency so that the specific serial number or physical bill is not as important in tracing as the value it represents.

The UTXO Direct Tracing Problem: Current industry practice often advocates tracing specific UTXOs through transactions, waiting for the exact UTXO from a victim's payment to move before continuing the trace. This approach violates fungibility principles and injects randomization into investigations. Wallet software autonomously selects which UTXOs to spend based on technical optimization (minimizing fees, avoiding change), not criminal intent. Following specific UTXOs disconnects the trace from timing and amount factors that would otherwise reveal suspect motives and behavioral patterns.

Cluster Tracing Limitations: While clustering wallet addresses under common ownership is crucial for network analysis and intelligence gathering, using clusters in asset tracing immediately substitutes traceable assets for non-traceable ones. This breaks the golden thread required for legal recovery. Consider three separate bank accounts (A, B, C) under one login: if account A contains $100,000 pre-existing funds and stolen money gets deposited into account C, moving the original funds from account A does not implicate those funds as traceable to the crime.

B.A.T.S. Position: The PIFO (Proceeds In First Out) method and traditional asset tracing principles remain applicable to UTXO transactions when properly applied. Rather than following specific UTXOs or cluster-wide activity, investigators should focus on wallet-level behavior and transaction timing that preserves the connection between criminal proceeds and subsequent movements. This approach maintains both technical accuracy and legal defensibility while avoiding the randomization effects of UTXO-specific or cluster-based tracing.

This methodology represents a contested position within the cryptocurrency investigation community, as it challenges prevailing industry practices encouraged by major blockchain intelligence companies. However, as cryptocurrency investigations mature and face increased legal scrutiny, maintaining alignment with established financial investigation precedents becomes essential for preserving the legal basis for asset recovery.

LIBR versus PIFO: Choosing Your Methodology
LIBR and PIFO represent fundamentally opposing philosophies about how criminals handle stolen funds, and investigators must understand this philosophical divide to make informed choices:

LIBR (Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule) operates on the principle that criminals have no authority to pass title on stolen property. This method seeks to preserve the tainted nature of funds as long as possible, tracking based on the lowest balance point between deposits and withdrawals. LIBR essentially argues that stolen funds "stick" to an account until the balance forces them out.

PIFO (Proceeds In First Out) assumes criminals inject ill-gotten gains into the money laundering process as quickly as possible, attempting to distance their proceeds from the crime and obfuscate the trail.

These methods are directly at odds with one another, yet B.A.T.S. supports both approaches, recognizing that different investigations may benefit from different methodologies. The critical requirement is consistency: once an investigator chooses a method at the start of an investigation, they must apply it throughout. B.A.T.S. does not permit arbitrary switching between methods to engineer favorable outcomes.

P.I.F.O. METHOD - Proceeds In First Out

Core Principle: When traced criminal proceeds enter a wallet, the very next outbound transaction contains those funds.

PIFO Scenarios:

Scenario 1: Basic PIFO
$5,000 Existing legitimate funds (Jan 1, 09:00)
$3,000 Criminal proceeds arrive (Jan 1, 14:30)
Balance: $8,000 | Next out = $3,000 criminal

Scenario 2: Partial Outflow
$5,000 Existing legitimate funds (Jan 1, 09:00)
$3,000 Criminal proceeds arrive (Jan 1, 14:30)
$1,500 First out (partial criminal) (Jan 1, 15:00)
Balance: $6,500 | Remaining criminal: $1,500
Next $1,500 out = remaining criminal proceeds

Scenario 3: New Funds After Criminal
$5,000 Existing legitimate funds (Jan 1, 09:00)
$3,000 Criminal proceeds arrive (Jan 1, 14:30)
$2,000 New legitimate funds arrive (Jan 1, 16:00)
Balance: $10,000 | Next out = $3,000 criminal
PIFO: Criminal proceeds still go out first

PIFO Application Steps:
1. Identify when criminal proceeds enter wallet
2. Find the chronologically next outbound transaction
3. Follow that transaction (regardless of amount)
4. Continue PIFO at each subsequent wallet

Legal Foundation: PIFO maintains the golden thread of traceability through commingling scenarios. This methodology aligns with established federal precedent recognizing PIFO as a valid method for tracking fungible assets through mixed accounts. See: U.S. v. Banco Cafetero Panama, 797 F.2d 1154 (2d Cir. 1986)

Practical Considerations for Method Selection:

Use LIBR when: You need to limit hop counts and conserve value in wallets that may be within reach of successful seizure through stablecoin burn and reissue tactics, or when dealing with wallets showing patterns of accumulation before movement.

Use PIFO when: You're following assets likely to flow through to VASPs where seizure requires cooperation with centralized entities, or when criminal patterns suggest rapid fund movement.

The choice often depends on your seizure strategy: LIBR may keep funds "closer" to the crime and within reach of novel seizure methods, while PIFO may better reflect actual criminal behavior in high-velocity money laundering operations.

SPECIALIZED APPLICATIONS: AML/CTF, TRAVEL RULE, AND SAR PRODUCTION
=======================================================================

B.A.T.S. Level Requirements by Use Case

SAR Production Requirements vary significantly based on complexity. Simple SAR filings may require only Level 1 discovery techniques to document basic transaction patterns. Complex suspicious activity involving sophisticated money laundering typically requires Level 2 intelligence development. When SAR filings relate to ongoing law enforcement investigations, coordination may require Level 3 case preparation standards.

Travel Rule Documentation Requirements mandate that Virtual Asset Service Providers collect and transmit specific information about cryptocurrency transfers exceeding regulatory thresholds. Investigations typically begin with Level 1 discovery techniques but may require Level 2 intelligence development for complex compliance scenarios or Level 3 standards for regulatory proceedings.

AML Risk Assessment Investigations vary in scope based on institutional risk tolerance and regulatory expectations. Basic AML screening might employ Level 1 discovery techniques, while comprehensive analysis for high-risk customers may require Level 2 intelligence development. AML violations requiring enforcement action typically escalate to Level 3 case preparation standards.

Match investigation depth to regulatory requirements and risk exposure

Universal Standards Across All Levels
Regardless of which method you choose or at which investigation level you begin, certain principles apply to all cryptocurrency investigations:

Make It Reproducible: Another investigator should be able to follow your work and reach the same conclusions. Document your sources, your reasoning, and your analytical choices.

Be Transparent About Limitations: If you can't trace certain funds or had to make assumptions, say so clearly. Honesty about limitations builds credibility.

Maintain Consistent Standards: If you decide to use a particular tracing method for some parts of your investigation and deviate for others, be clear about where you're applying which method and articulate your reasoning for the change.

Keep the End Goal in Mind: Even during early-stage analysis, consider what type of evidence you might eventually need and document accordingly.

Technical Consistency
• Verify Wallet Addresses: Double-check addresses to prevent transcription errors that can invalidate your analysis.
• Use Standard Time Zones: Document all timestamps in UTC to avoid confusion.
• Save Transaction Hashes: Preserve the unique identifiers that let others verify your findings.
• Take Consistent Screenshots: Develop standard procedures for visual evidence whether that be opensource explorer tools or graph exports from your preferred forensic tool.

Analytical Frameworks: Transaction Analysis versus Cluster Analysis
Transaction analysis maintains mathematical traceability between specific transactions and amounts, treating each transaction as discrete movement of identifiable funds. This approach enables investigators to demonstrate that particular cryptocurrency holdings represent specific criminal proceeds, making it essential for asset forfeiture cases.

Cluster analysis examines relationships and patterns across multiple addresses without focusing on specific transaction flows, identifying relationships through behavioral patterns revealing common ownership. This methodology supports intelligence development and network mapping by revealing criminal organization structure.

=======================================================================
DIRECTIONAL ANALYSIS: FORWARD AND REVERSE TRACING
=======================================================================

Forward vs Backward Tracing: Two Paths, One Goal

Forward Tracing (Criminal Investigations)
KNOWN BAD (RED) → Criminal Cases
• Follow victim funds
• Map criminal networks
• Identify cash-out points
• Build prosecution cases

Backward Tracing (AML/Compliance)
KNOWN BAD ← AML/Compliance
• Risk assessment
• Source of funds
• Customer due diligence
• SAR filing support

INVESTIGATIVE CROSSOVER
• YELLOW Hub Wallets
• PURPLE Exchanges
• GRAY Obfuscated
• Terminal Points

Key Insight: Both workflows meet at significant wallets, creating opportunities for collaborative investigation

Directional Analysis: Forward and Reverse Tracing
Cryptocurrency investigations can move in two directions. Forward tracing follows funds from victim to criminal, maintaining direct connections suitable for asset recovery and prosecution. Reverse tracing works backward from known criminal infrastructure to identify funding sources.

The B.A.T.S. framework serves both criminal investigators and AML/CTF professionals by recognizing that both groups employ identical methodologies, merely entering the investigative cycle at different points. Criminal investigators typically begin with victim reports (RED wallets) and trace forward to discover criminal infrastructure. AML/CTF professionals often begin with known criminal infrastructure (sanctioned addresses, suspicious activity) and trace backward to identify exposure and potential victims.

Unified Framework for Criminal and AML/CTF Investigations
Both groups utilize the same wallet classification system, with RED wallets always representing victim-facing addresses where funds were criminally obtained. When AML investigations identify criminal infrastructure, these are classified according to their function (YELLOW for hub wallets, PURPLE for exchanges, etc.) rather than creating new categories. This unified approach ensures seamless handoffs between compliance teams and law enforcement.

Backward Discovery Within Forward Focused Investigations
During Level 3 and 4 investigations, investigators frequently encounter terminal wallets (typically exchanges) containing significantly more funds than their traced thread values. When a thread of $50,000 enters an exchange wallet holding $1,000,000, investigators must make a diligent effort to determine the source of the remaining $950,000 to maximize asset recovery opportunities and exhibit criminal intent.

This backward discovery process operates as an embedded Level 1 exercise within the higher-level investigation. Investigators work backward from the terminal wallet using rapid assessment techniques to identify potential additional criminal sources or victims. This backward phase prioritizes speed over documentation precision - investigators are seeking new starting points rather than building evidentiary trails.

Once potential RED wallets or criminal sources are identified upstream, investigators transition back to forward tracing from these newly discovered origins. This creates a natural investigative rhythm: backward for discovery, forward for documentation. Hop counting and meticulous documentation only apply during the forward phase.

=======================================================================
THE FOUR INVESTIGATION LEVELS: MATCHING METHOD TO PURPOSE
=======================================================================

Every cryptocurrency investigation falls into one of four categories based on what you're trying to accomplish. Each level builds on the previous one, but you don't always need to progress through all four. The level you choose depends on your case goals and available resources.

B.A.T.S. Investigation Framework:

Level 1: Discovery (10-60 min) - Quick Case Assessment
• Initial triage: worth pursuing?
• Scope estimation
• Lead generation
• Pattern recognition
Output: Go/no-go decision with basic intelligence

Level 2: Intelligence (1-40 hrs) - Network Behavior Mapping
• RED wallet index creation
• Operational patterns
• Hub wallet identification
• 80% rule application
Output: RED index & criminal network understanding

Level 3: Case Preparation (1-5 days) - Prosecution-Ready Evidence
• Universal wallet index
• V-T notation system
• PIFO/LIBR methodology
• Legal narrative development
Output: Court-ready evidence with full wallet index

Level 4: Asset Forfeiture (5+ days) - Mathematical Precision for Seizure
• V-T-H notation (hop counting)
• Root validation & threads
• Transaction-centric analysis
• Write-off documentation
Output: Golden thread proof for asset recovery

Key Principle: Each level builds on the previous, but you don't always need to progress through all four. Choose based on your legal objectives and available resources.

For AML/CTF Professionals:
Level 1-2 for SAR filing | Level 3 for law enforcement support
Same methodology, different entry points

Match your method to your goals
Wrong approach = wasted time or failed cases

=======================================================================
LEVEL 1: DISCOVERY - GETTING YOUR BEARINGS
=======================================================================

Purpose: Quick assessment and lead generation
When to use: Initial case evaluation, understanding scope, finding leads

Discovery analysis focuses on exploration over documentation. You're following interesting patterns to see where they lead, making go/no-go decisions about case priority, and identifying potential for deeper investigation.

What You're Looking For:
• Exchange Connections: Wallets that send funds to known cryptocurrency exchanges represent potential cash-out points
• Obvious Timing Patterns: Multiple wallets moving funds at similar times establishing patterns of activity can show concerted efforts or provide clues on geographical location.
• Shared Infrastructure: Different parts of your investigation using the same mixing services, bridges, or tools indicating common operational patterns
• Large Hub Wallets: Addresses that appear to receive from multiple identified or suspected victim sources

Documentation Standards:
• Minimal formal documentation
• Essential screenshots of key transactions and patterns
• Quick notes in whatever format works: "Victim → 3 hops → HTX deposit"
• Rough estimates: "~$50K root total, ~$30K to Binance"
• Key observations: "small amounts moving regularly to Cash App"

End-of-Discovery Summary (5 minutes maximum):
• Worth pursuing? [Yes/No]
• Estimated scope: [Small/Medium/Large operation]
• Key destinations: [Exchange names or services]
• Obvious patterns: [One-line description]
• Recommended next level: [Intelligence/Case Prep/Asset Forfeiture]
• Time invested: [minutes]

What NOT to Document: Transaction hashes, precise amounts, formal wallet classifications, detailed timing analysis, or mathematical accounting. Discovery is about speed and intuition - save the precision for higher levels.

Time Investment: 10-60 minutes

Example: You receive a complaint about a romance scam where a victim lost $25,000 in Bitcoin. During your initial analysis, you need to quickly assess whether this case warrants deeper investigation. You trace the victim's funds through several transactions and discover that they eventually arrive at a wallet that has previously received funds from known Lazarus Group infrastructure. Additionally, you notice that the transaction amounts and timing patterns match indicators from a recent FinCEN advisory about North Korean cryptocurrency theft operations.

This discovery phase analysis, completed in minutes, immediately elevates the case priority and triggers notifications to relevant sanctions enforcement teams. The pattern recognition during discovery suggests this isn't an isolated romance scam but potentially part of a larger DPRK-affiliated operation targeting multiple victims.

Limitations: Discovery creates leads and intelligence, not court-ready evidence. However, discovery gives you the most information per hour invested and helps you decide whether deeper analysis is worthwhile.

For AML/CTF Professionals:
The same decision framework applies when assessing suspicious activity:

Start with Regulatory Requirements:
• Below SAR thresholds? Level 1 discovery may suffice for risk assessment
• Meets SAR filing requirements? Level 2 intelligence development needed
• Law enforcement requesting support? Level 3 case preparation standards apply

Consider Risk Exposure:
• Direct exposure (0-1 hops from known bad)? Higher level analysis warranted
• Indirect exposure (2-3 hops)? Level 1-2 may be sufficient
• Distant exposure (4+ hops)? Document and monitor

Plan for Case Evolution
Many cases start at one level and evolve to require higher levels of analysis. A case might:
1. Begin as Level 1 discovery to assess scope
2. Develop into Level 2 intelligence development as patterns emerge
3. Progress to Level 3 case preparation when suspects are identified
4. Finally require Level 4 asset forfeiture analysis when seizure opportunities arise

Design your documentation to support this evolution. Even during initial discovery, maintain standards that will allow you to escalate your analysis if circumstances change. The wallet numbering system must remain stable and permanent once established in Level 2 - wallet IDs assigned never change when transitioning between levels.

=======================================================================
LEVEL 2: INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPMENT - UNDERSTANDING CRIMINAL OPERATIONS
=======================================================================

Purpose: Wallet behavior analysis and network mapping
When to use: Understanding how criminal operations work, preparing for complex investigations.

Intelligence development helps you understand criminal network structure and operational methodology. The focus shifts from following specific victim funds to analyzing how wallets behave, and criminal networks operate.

RED Wallet Index Creation: This is where you create the first formal wallet index - the RED wallet index. Each victim-facing wallet gets assigned a formal identifier (R1, R2, R3, etc.) that will remain permanent throughout the investigation. This index serves as the foundation for all subsequent analysis.

Network Behavior Description: Beyond the RED wallet index, describe wallet behaviors without assigning formal IDs. For example: "The network employs 20 intermediary wallets before converging at a hub wallet" rather than naming each individual wallet. Formal ID assignment for non-RED wallets occurs later when creating the universal wallet index.

Key Investigation Techniques:
• Gas Fee Analysis: When criminals operate multiple wallets, they may pay transaction fees from a single funding source - identifying these patterns proves common control
• Network Structure Mapping: Document how RED wallets interact with intermediary
