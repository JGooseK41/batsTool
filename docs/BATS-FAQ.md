# B.A.T.S. Framework - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is B.A.T.S.?
B.A.T.S. (Block Audit Tracing Standard) is a revolutionary framework for cryptocurrency investigation that maintains the "golden thread" of traceability required for successful asset forfeiture cases. It provides a standardized approach through systematic color classification, hierarchical notation, and mathematical validation.

### Why is B.A.T.S. necessary?
Traditional blockchain analysis tools often fail to maintain the mathematical precision required for asset forfeiture. B.A.T.S. addresses this gap by:
- Maintaining an unbroken connection between victim funds and seized assets
- Providing mathematical certainty that courts require
- Preventing investigation scope creep
- Standardizing documentation for legal proceedings

### What is the "Golden Thread" principle?
The Golden Thread is the unbroken connection between a victim's original funds and any assets ultimately seized by law enforcement. This principle is essential for proving in court that specific seized cryptocurrency originated from criminal activity rather than legitimate sources.

## Methodology Questions

### What is V-T-H Notation?
V-T-H Notation is the standardized identification system where:
- **V** = Victim number
- **T** = Transaction number  
- **H** = Hop count from the victim-facing wallet

Example: V1-T2-H3 means Victim 1, Transaction 2, at 3 hops from the original receiving wallet.

### How does the color classification system work?
B.A.T.S. uses a color-coded wallet classification system:
- **RED**: Victim-facing wallets (first to receive stolen funds)
- **YELLOW**: Hub wallets where multiple victim traces converge
- **PURPLE**: Exchange deposit addresses requiring legal process
- **BLUE**: Cold storage wallets
- **BLACK**: Standard intermediary wallets
- **PINK, ORANGE, BROWN, GRAY, GREEN**: Additional classifications for specific scenarios

### What is the PIFO Method?
PIFO (Proceeds In First Out) is the principle that when traced funds enter a wallet, the very next outbound transaction contains those funds, applied strictly chronologically. This maintains the golden thread through commingled funds.

### How does hop counting work?
Hop count measures distance from the victim-facing wallet, not chronological discovery order. Each blockchain transaction increments the hop count by one. This standardized measurement ensures consistent documentation across complex investigations.

## Technical Questions

### What is Root Validation?
Root Validation is the mathematical verification process ensuring that all thread totals at any given hop level sum to the adjusted root total. This provides:
- Proof of investigation completeness
- Prevention of scope creep  
- Courtroom-ready evidence

### How are write-offs handled?
B.A.T.S. recognizes practical investigation limitations through systematic write-offs:
- **Dust write-offs**: Transactions below practical thresholds (typically <$50)
- **Dilution write-offs**: When amounts become impractically small percentages
- **Obfuscation write-offs**: Assets entering mixers or privacy coins
- **Operational write-offs**: Resource limitations requiring abandonment

### What is the Sequential Hop Rule?
When multiple trace paths converge at the same wallet and move out together, apply the highest hop count among all converging paths, plus one for the outbound transaction. This maintains accurate distance measurement from victims.

## Legal and Compliance Questions

### How does B.A.T.S. support asset forfeiture cases?
B.A.T.S. provides:
- Mathematical certainty required by courts
- Documented chain of custody for digital assets
- Standardized reports that prosecutors understand
- Evidence that withstands defense challenges

### What about privacy considerations?
B.A.T.S. emphasizes:
- Proportionality to suspected criminal activity
- Scope discipline to avoid unnecessary exposure
- Professional standards equivalent to traditional financial investigations
- Balance between effective law enforcement and individual rights

### How does B.A.T.S. handle commingling?
When criminal proceeds mix with legitimate funds, B.A.T.S. applies:
- Strict PIFO principles
- Mathematical tracking of specific portions
- Documentation of commingling points
- Maintenance of the golden thread through complexity

## Implementation Questions

### What are the different B.A.T.S. levels?
1. **B.A.T.S. 1 - Discovery**: Quick assessment for case viability
2. **B.A.T.S. 2 - Intelligence**: Understanding criminal networks
3. **B.A.T.S. 3 - Case Preparation**: Court-ready evidence
4. **B.A.T.S. 4 - Asset Forfeiture**: Mathematical precision for seizure

### How long does a B.A.T.S. investigation take?
Timeline depends on:
- Investigation complexity
- Number of victims and transactions
- Blockchain activity patterns
- Required precision level

Basic investigations may take hours, while complex asset forfeiture cases can require weeks of detailed analysis.

### What tools support B.A.T.S. methodology?
The B.A.T.S. Tool provides:
- Automated V-T-H notation assignment
- Real-time root validation
- Multi-blockchain support
- Export capabilities for legal documentation
- Visual flow diagrams
- Wallet classification tracking

### What is the difference between Transactions, Hops, and Entries?

**Transaction**: A general term for any blockchain money movement, including:
- The victim's original loss (recorded in the Victims tab as V1-T1, V1-T2, etc.)
- Any subsequent blockchain transaction during the investigation

**Hop**: A distance level from the victim's original transaction:
- **Hop 0**: The victim transaction itself (funds arriving at the criminal's RED wallet)
- **Hop 1**: The FIRST movement of stolen funds FROM the RED wallet
- **Hop 2**: The next movement from Hop 1 wallets
- Each hop represents one blockchain transaction distance from the victim

**Entry**: An individual record within a hop that documents where funds went:
- Multiple entries can exist in one hop (when funds split to different wallets)
- Each entry consumes one or more source threads
- Entry types include:
  - **Trace entry**: Normal fund movement to another wallet
  - **DEX/Swap entry**: Currency conversion (doesn't increment hop number)
  - **Write-off entry**: Funds abandoned (dust, mixer, etc.)
  - **Cold storage**: Funds parked in storage wallet

**Source Thread**: A traceable amount from a previous hop or victim transaction:
- Identified by V-T-H notation (e.g., V1-T1-H1)
- Carries a specific amount and currency
- Must be fully accounted for across all entries

### Example Investigation Flow:
```
Victim loses $10,000 USDT → Creates V1-T1 (transaction)
    ↓
Arrives at criminal's RED wallet → This is Hop 0
    ↓
Criminal splits funds in Hop 1:
- $6,000 to Wallet A → Hop 1, Entry 1 (consumes thread V1-T1)
- $4,000 to Wallet B → Hop 1, Entry 2 (consumes thread V1-T1)
    ↓
From Wallet A in Hop 2:
- $6,000 to Exchange → Hop 2, Entry 1 (consumes thread V1-T1-H1)
```

The hierarchy: **Investigation → Hops → Entries → Source Threads**
