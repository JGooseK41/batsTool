## Core Principles and Methodology {#core-principles}

### The Reproducible Investigation Standard

**KEY PRINCIPLE**: The B.A.T.S. methodology ensures that **any qualified investigator can reproduce another investigator's results** and **seamlessly continue where another left off** by following the standardized notation, validation rules, and documentation requirements.

This reproducibility is achieved through:
- **Standardized V-T-H Notation System**
- **Mathematical Validation at Each Stage**
- **Consistent Wallet Classification**
- **Documented Decision Points**
- **Root Total Validation**

### The Golden Thread Principle

B.A.T.S. maintains an unbroken mathematical and legal connection between:
- Original victim losses
- Each intermediate transaction
- Terminal wallet destinations
- Asset recovery opportunities

### Mathematical Foundation

Every B.A.T.S. investigation maintains mathematical precision through:
```
Adjusted Root Total (ART) = Original Root Total - Documented Write-offs

At every hop level:
Sum(All Active Thread Amounts) = ART
```

---

## Investigation Architecture: Traces → Hops → Entries → Threads → Transactions {#investigation-architecture}

### Understanding the Hierarchical Structure

B.A.T.S. investigations are built using a five-tier hierarchical structure that provides both organization and mathematical validation:

```
TRACE (Complete Investigation)
└── HOPS (Distance from victim-facing wallet)
    └── ENTRIES (Individual movements or actions)
        └── THREADS (Specific fund tracking)
            └── TRANSACTIONS (Blockchain origin)
```

### 1. TRACES: The Complete Investigation

**Trace Definition**: A trace represents the complete investigation from victim losses through all subsequent movements until terminal wallets or write-offs.

**Trace Components**:
- **Root Total**: Sum of all victim losses
- **Adjusted Root Total (ART)**: Root total minus write-offs
- **Complete Hop Chain**: All movements from origin to terminal
- **Validation Records**: Mathematical proof at each level

### 2. HOPS: Distance-Based Organization

**Hop Definition**: A hop represents the distance from the victim-facing wallet, with each blockchain transaction incrementing the hop count by one.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Hop 0**: Victim transactions (money leaving victim control)
- **Hop 1**: First movement from victim-facing (RED) wallets
- **Hop 2**: Second blockchain transaction in the chain
- **Hop N**: N blockchain transactions from the victim

**Hop Completion Rules**:
- A hop is "completed" when all available funds at that level are accounted for
- Completed hops can be reopened for editing if new evidence emerges
- The Adjusted Root Total (ART) must be fully allocated before hop completion

### 3. ENTRIES: Individual Movements and Actions

**Entry Definition**: An entry represents a specific action taken with traced funds at a particular hop level. Each entry consumes one or more threads and may create new threads.

**Entry Types**:
- **Trace**: Following funds to a new wallet (consumes thread, creates new thread)
- **Swap**: Currency conversion within the same wallet (consumes thread in one currency, creates thread in another)
- **Write-off**: Documented abandonment of untraceable funds (consumes thread, no output)
- **Cold Storage**: Long-term storage identification (consumes thread, creates monitoring point)

**Entry Components**:
```
Entry Structure:
├── Source Thread ID(s) (which threads are consumed)
├── Amount and Currency
├── Destination Information
├── Transaction Hash(es)
├── Wallet Classification
├── Output Thread (if created)
├── Investigator Notes
└── Validation Status
```

### 4. THREADS: Specific Fund Tracking

**Thread Definition**: A thread represents a specific amount of traceable funds at a particular point in the investigation. Threads originate from victim transactions and flow through the trace.

**Thread Lifecycle**:
```
ORIGINATION: V1-T1 (Victim 1, Transaction 1) creates initial thread
     ↓
CONSUMPTION: Thread used by Hop 1 entry
     ↓
CREATION: New thread V1-T1-H1 created at destination
     ↓
CONTINUATION: Process repeats at each hop
     ↓
TERMINATION: Thread ends at terminal wallet or write-off
```

**Thread Notation**:
- **V1-T1**: Original thread from victim transaction
- **V1-T1-H1**: Thread after first hop
- **V1-T1-H1_BTC**: Thread after currency swap to BTC
- **V1-T1,V2-T1-H2**: Commingled threads

**Thread Rules**:
- **Conservation**: Thread amounts cannot increase (only decrease via fees/loss)
- **Allocation**: Threads can only be allocated once
- **Validation**: Sum of all active threads = ART at each hop
- **Termination**: Threads ending at terminal wallets cannot create new threads

### 5. TRANSACTIONS: Blockchain Origin Points

**Transaction Role**: Transactions are the immutable blockchain records from which threads originate and through which they flow.

**Transaction as Thread Origin**:
```
Victim Transaction (Blockchain):
├── Transaction Hash: 0xabc...
├── Amount: 10,000 USDT
├── From: Victim Wallet
├── To: RED Wallet (0xdef...)
└── Creates Thread: V1-T1 (10,000 USDT available)
```

**Critical Elements**:
- **Transaction Hash**: Unique blockchain identifier
- **Amount**: Exact value that becomes thread amount
- **Timestamp**: Chronological ordering (for PIFO)
- **Source/Destination**: Defines thread flow
- **Currency**: Determines thread currency type

### Building the Investigation: Step-by-Step Process

#### Understanding the Hierarchy Through Example

```
Example: $10,000 USDT Theft Investigation

TRANSACTION (Blockchain Record):
└── Tx Hash: 0xabc123... ($10,000 USDT from victim to 0xRED...)
    └── Creates THREAD: V1-T1 ($10,000 USDT available)
        └── Consumed by ENTRY: Trace entry in Hop 1
            └── Part of HOP 1: First movement from RED wallet
                └── Builds the TRACE: Complete investigation path

Breaking it down:
1. TRANSACTION: Victim loses $10,000 USDT (creates thread V1-T1)
2. THREAD: V1-T1 represents the $10,000 to be traced
3. ENTRY: Uses V1-T1 to trace funds to new wallet
4. HOP: Contains all entries at 1 hop from victim
5. TRACE: The complete path from victim to terminal
```

#### Phase 1: Transaction Documentation (Thread Creation)
1. **Record victim transactions** (blockchain evidence)
2. **Each transaction creates a thread** (V1-T1, V1-T2, etc.)
3. **Threads carry the amount** from the transaction
4. **Establish Root Total** (sum of all threads)

#### Phase 2: Entry Creation (Thread Consumption)
```
For each movement:
1. Select source thread(s) with available funds
2. Create entry consuming those threads
3. Entry generates new thread at destination
4. Validate thread allocation ≤ available amount
```

#### Phase 3: Hop Organization (Entry Grouping)
```
Hop structure:
├── Hop 1: All entries 1 transaction from victim
│   ├── Entry 1: V1-T1 → New wallet (creates V1-T1-H1)
│   ├── Entry 2: V1-T2 → Different wallet (creates V1-T2-H1)
│   └── Validation: All threads accounted for
├── Hop 2: All entries 2 transactions from victim
│   ├── Entry 1: V1-T1-H1 → Next wallet
│   └── Entry 2: V1-T2-H1 → Exchange (terminal)
```

#### Phase 4: Trace Completion (Investigation Whole)
- **Trace includes all hops** from origin to terminal
- **Mathematical validation** at every level
- **Complete documentation** for legal proceedings
- **Thread termination** at exchanges or write-offs

## Currency Swaps and ART Maintenance {#currency-swaps}

### The Swap Challenge in Cryptocurrency Investigations

Currency swaps represent one of the most complex aspects of cryptocurrency tracing, as they:
- Change the currency type while maintaining criminal provenance
- Create new threads in different currencies
- Require careful ART (Adjusted Root Total) management
- Maintain the golden thread through currency conversion

### How B.A.T.S. Handles Swaps

#### 1. Dual-Thread System

When a swap occurs, B.A.T.S. maintains two thread perspectives:

**Input Thread (Consumed)**:
```
V1-T1-H2: 1000 USDC → [SWAP ENTRY] → Thread Consumed
```

**Output Thread (Created)**:
```
V1-T1-H2_USDT: 995 USDT → Available for next hop
```

#### 2. ART Management Across Currencies

The ART must be maintained separately by currency:

```
Original ART:
- USDC: $50,000
- BTC: $25,000
- ETH: $30,000

After Swap (1000 USDC → 995 USDT):
- USDC: $49,000 (reduced)
- USDT: $995 (new)
- BTC: $25,000 (unchanged)
- ETH: $30,000 (unchanged)

Total ART: $104,995 (maintained)
```

#### 3. Swap Entry Documentation

Every swap entry contains:
```
Swap Entry Requirements:
├── Input Amount and Currency
├── Output Amount and Currency
├── Exchange Rate Documentation
├── DEX/Platform Identification
├── Slippage/Fee Analysis
├── Smart Contract Address (if applicable)
└── Temporal Analysis
```

#### 4. Thread Notation for Swaps

B.A.T.S. uses suffix notation to track currency conversions:
```
Original Thread: V1-T1-H1 (1000 USDC)
After Swap: V1-T1-H1_USDT (995 USDT)
Further Trace: V1-T1-H1_USDT-H2 (995 USDT to new wallet)
```

### Advanced Swap Scenarios

#### Multi-Step Swaps
```
V1-T1-H1: USDC → WETH → DAI → USDT
Notation: V1-T1-H1_WETH_DAI_USDT
```

#### Partial Swaps
```
Original: V1-T1-H1 (1000 USDC)
Partial Swap: 600 USDC → 595 USDT
Result:
- V1-T1-H1 (400 USDC remaining)
- V1-T1-H1_USDT (595 USDT created)
```

#### Cross-Chain Bridges
```
V1-T1-H1: 1 ETH (Ethereum) → 0.99 ETH (Polygon)
Notation: V1-T1-H1_POLY
```

### Validation Rules for Swaps

1. **Conservation Check**: Input value ≈ Output value (within market tolerance)
2. **Timing Validation**: Swap occurs within reasonable timeframe
3. **Rate Verification**: Exchange rate matches market conditions
4. **Platform Verification**: DEX/CEX identification and validation
5. **ART Reconciliation**: Total ART maintained across all currencies

## Reproducibility and Handoff Capability {#reproducibility}

### The Handoff Problem in Cryptocurrency Investigations

Traditional cryptocurrency investigations often fail when:
- **Documentation is incomplete** or investigator-specific
- **Methodology is inconsistent** between team members
- **Validation steps are skipped** or poorly documented
- **Decision rationale is not captured**

### B.A.T.S. Solution: Complete Reproducibility

#### 1. Standardized Documentation Requirements

Every B.A.T.S. investigation maintains:
```
Required Documentation:

│   ├── Methodology selection (PIFO/LIBR)
│   └── Legal requirements
├── Victim Documentation
│   ├── Complete transaction details
│   ├── Loss calculations
│   └── Root total establishment
├── Hop-by-Hop Records
│   ├── Entry-level documentation
│   ├── Source thread validation
│   ├── Decision rationale
│   └── Mathematical verification
└── Validation Records
    ├── ART reconciliation at each hop
    ├── Thread allocation tracking
    └── Quality control checkpoints
```

#### 2. Universal Notation System

**V-T-H Notation** provides unambiguous identification:
```
V1-T1: Victim 1, Transaction 1 (at RED wallet)
V1-T1-H1: First hop from that transaction
V2-T3-H5_BTC: Victim 2, Transaction 3, Hop 5, converted to BTC
```

#### 3. Reproducible Decision Points

At every decision point, B.A.T.S. requires documentation of:
- **Available options** considered
- **Selection criteria** applied
- **Methodology justification**
- **Alternative approaches** rejected
