# B.A.T.S. Quick Start Guide

## 5-Minute Overview

### What You're Doing
You're creating a mathematically perfect trail from stolen cryptocurrency to criminal wallets, maintaining an unbreakable "golden thread" that courts require for asset forfeiture.

### The Four Levels of B.A.T.S.

1. **Discovery** (Quick Assessment)
   - Is this case worth pursuing?
   - Where did the money go initially?
   - Time: Hours

2. **Intelligence** (Network Understanding)  
   - Who are the criminals?
   - How do they operate?
   - Time: Days

3. **Case Preparation** (Court Evidence)
   - Build prosecution-ready documentation
   - Identify all criminal wallets
   - Time: Weeks

4. **Asset Forfeiture** (Mathematical Precision)
   - Prove exact fund movements
   - Support seizure/forfeiture
   - Time: Weeks to months

## Starting Your First Investigation

### Step 1: Setup (5 minutes)
1. Open the B.A.T.S. Tool
2. Enter case details:
   - Case ID (your reference)
   - Investigator name
   - Case type
   - Brief synopsis

### Step 2: Document Victims (10 minutes per victim)
1. Click "Add Victim"
2. For each victim transaction:
   - Paste transaction hash
   - Click "Lookup" (auto-fills details)
   - Verify receiving wallet (RED wallet)
   - Add any notes

### Step 3: Confirm Root Total (2 minutes)
1. Click "Generate Root Total"
2. Review the breakdown
3. Confirm to establish your baseline
4. This is your "Adjusted Root Total" (ART)

### Step 4: Begin Tracing (Time varies)
1. Start with Hop 1 from each RED wallet
2. Follow the PIFO rule (first money out)
3. Document each transaction
4. Assign wallet colors

### Step 5: Validate Progress (Continuous)
- At each hop level, all amounts must sum to ART
- If they don't, you've missed transactions
- The tool validates automatically

## Key Concepts in Plain English

### V-T-H Notation
Think of it like a family tree:
- **V1** = First victim
- **T1** = Their first transaction
- **H1** = One hop away from victim

Example: V1-T1-H3 = "First victim's first transaction, three hops away"

### Wallet Colors (Easy Memory Tricks)
- **RED** = "Really Early Deposits" (victim-facing)
- **YELLOW** = "Yes, Everyone Links Lowlifes Or Wallets" (convergence points)
- **PURPLE** = "Please Use Regulatory Process Legal Exchange" (exchanges)
- **BLUE** = "Basically Locked Up Eternally" (cold storage)
- **BLACK** = "Basic Laundering Account Carrying Krypto" (everything else)

### The Golden Thread
Imagine a rope connecting victim to criminal:
- Can't break the rope (maintain connection)
- Can't add extra rope (no scope creep)
- Must follow the rope exactly (PIFO method)

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Theft
```
Victim → RED wallet → BLACK wallet → PURPLE exchange
V1-T1  → V1-T1-H1  → V1-T1-H2
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Victims Converge
```
V1-T1 → RED1 → BLACK1 ↘
                        YELLOW (hub) → PURPLE exchange
V2-T1 → RED2 → BLACK2 ↗
```

### Scenario 3: Funds Split
```
                   ↗ BLACK2 (→ $3,000) → More hops
V1-T1 → RED → BLACK1 
($10,000)          ↘ BLACK3 (→ $7,000) → More hops
```

## Do's and Don'ts

### DO:
- ✓ Validate at every hop level
- ✓ Document write-offs with reasons
- ✓ Use consistent wallet colors
- ✓ Follow money chronologically
- ✓ Save your work frequently

### DON'T:
- ✗ Skip validation steps
- ✗ Change wallet colors once assigned
- ✗ Follow money out of order
- ✗ Exceed your root total
- ✗ Abandon trails without documentation

## Troubleshooting

### "My totals don't match!"
1. Check for missed transactions
2. Verify your math
3. Look for convergences
4. Review write-offs

### "Too many transactions to follow"
1. Use justified write-offs for dust
2. Focus on significant amounts
3. Document abandonment reasons
4. Maintain ART accuracy

### "Funds went to a mixer"
1. Document the mixer deposit
2. Create obfuscation write-off
3. Note in final report
4. Check if funds exit mixer

## Next Steps

### After Your First Trace:
1. Export your report
2. Review wallet classifications
3. Check for patterns
4. Plan legal process

### Growing Your Skills:
1. Practice with simple cases first
2. Build to complex networks
3. Study convergence patterns
4. Learn exchange indicators

### Getting Help:
- Reference the full methodology guide
- Check FAQ for specific questions
- Review benefits documentation
- Join the B.A.T.S. community

## Remember
B.A.T.S. is like learning to ride a bike:
- Awkward at first
- Becomes natural with practice
- Soon you'll trace without thinking
- Always maintains perfect balance (mathematical validation)

Start with simple cases, build confidence, and soon you'll be tracing complex criminal networks with mathematical certainty!
