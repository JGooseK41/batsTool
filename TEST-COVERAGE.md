# B.A.T.S. Tool Comprehensive Test Coverage Report

## Test Simulation Overview

The test simulation suite runs **1000 automated scenarios** with randomized parameters to stress-test all aspects of the B.A.T.S. tool and identify potential bugs.

## Test Parameters

### Variable Ranges
- **Victims**: 1-10 per investigation
- **Transactions**: 1-20 per victim
- **Hops**: 1-40 per investigation
- **Entries per hop**: 1-5
- **Currencies**: USDT, USDC, ETH, BTC, DAI
- **Entry types**: trace, swap, writeoff, terminal

## Test Categories

### 1. **Tracing Logic**
Tests thread allocation, availability tracking, and fund flow accuracy.

**Common Issues to Detect:**
- Thread over-allocation
- Incorrect available amount calculations
- Lost funds during transfers
- Orphaned threads

### 2. **Commingling & Splitting**
Tests scenarios where multiple threads merge or single threads split.

**Common Issues to Detect:**
- Incorrect notation for commingled funds
- Split detection failures
- Thread merging calculation errors
- Missing source thread references

### 3. **Currency Swaps**
Tests DEX swaps and currency conversions.

**Common Issues to Detect:**
- Invalid swap ratios
- Missing output currency threads
- Swap detail data corruption
- Thread creation in wrong currency

### 4. **Terminal Wallets**
Tests exchange detection and terminal wallet handling.

**Common Issues to Detect:**
- Missing terminal wallet index entries
- Incorrect wallet type classification
- Exchange name attribution failures
- Terminal wallet not stopping trace

### 5. **Validation Rules**
Tests amount validation, wallet formats, and business rules.

**Common Issues to Detect:**
- Negative or zero amounts accepted
- Invalid wallet addresses processed
- Completed hops with zero totals
- Transaction hash duplicates

### 6. **Graph Generation**
Tests visualization with complex scenarios.

**Performance Concerns with:**
- 40+ hop investigations
- 100+ total entries
- Multiple currency types
- Heavy commingling patterns

### 7. **Report Generation**
Tests export functionality and data integrity.

**Common Issues to Detect:**
- Missing transaction data
- Incorrect total calculations
- Currency conversion errors
- Formatting issues in exports

### 8. **Edge Cases**

**Scenario Types Tested:**
- Single victim with 100+ transactions
- 40 hops with single entries each
- Complete fund writeoffs
- 100% terminal wallet arrivals
- Multi-currency investigations
- Circular fund flows
- Zero-amount traces

## Expected Bug Categories

### Critical Bugs (Data Loss/Corruption)
- Thread allocation exceeding available funds
- Lost funds during swaps
- Terminal wallet funds continuing to trace
- Hop completion with unallocated threads

### Major Bugs (Workflow Disruption)
- Graph generation failures with 30+ hops
- Report generation timeout with large datasets
- Edit operations corrupting completed hops
- Validation allowing invalid entries

### Minor Bugs (UI/UX Issues)
- Overlapping nodes in complex graphs
- Incorrect status displays
- Missing validation warnings
- Confusing error messages

## Performance Benchmarks

The test suite measures:
- Maximum victims processed successfully
- Maximum hops handled without errors
- Graph generation time vs. hop count
- Report generation time vs. data size
- Thread management efficiency

## How to Run Tests

1. Open `test-simulation.html` in a browser
2. Configure test parameters (or use defaults)
3. Click "Run Simulations"
4. Monitor progress and live statistics
5. Review results summary
6. Export detailed results as JSON

## Interpreting Results

### Pass Rate
- **>95%**: Excellent stability
- **90-95%**: Good, minor issues
- **80-90%**: Significant bugs present
- **<80%**: Critical issues need fixing

### Issue Categories
Each category shows count of issues found:
- **0**: No issues in category
- **1-10**: Minor concerns
- **10-50**: Needs investigation
- **>50**: Systematic problem

### Performance Metrics
- **Max Victims**: Should handle 10+ without issues
- **Max Hops**: Should handle 40+ without crashes
- **Graph Gen Time**: Should be <500ms for most cases

## Known Limitations

The test suite simulates:
- Random but valid wallet addresses
- Simplified transaction hashes
- Basic exchange detection
- Standard currency pairs

It does NOT test:
- Real blockchain API calls
- Actual exchange API integration
- File import/export operations
- Browser compatibility issues
- Concurrent user sessions

## Action Items from Testing

Based on test results, prioritize fixes for:

1. **Data Integrity Issues**
   - Thread over-allocation bugs
   - Swap currency tracking errors
   - Terminal wallet index consistency

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Graph rendering for 30+ hops
   - Report generation for large datasets
   - Thread calculation efficiency

3. **Validation Improvements**
   - Stricter amount validation
   - Better duplicate detection
   - Clearer error messages

4. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Better graph layout algorithm
   - Improved status indicators
   - More intuitive workflows

## Summary

This comprehensive test suite provides automated testing of 1000 scenarios covering all major features and edge cases of the B.A.T.S. tool. Regular runs help identify regressions and ensure stability as new features are added.

Run tests after any significant code changes to maintain quality and catch bugs early in the development cycle.
