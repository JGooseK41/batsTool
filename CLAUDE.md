**Commit:** e10954cdf9cf67a120a306073d9341ad4e1b72c7
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Strengthen currency separation to ensure proper scaling

- Fixed calculateRootTotal() to return object with totals by currency
- Fixed convergence handling to track each currency separately
- Removed duplicate currency calculation in import function
- Ensured all currency totals are kept separate throughout the system
- Convergence now shows '100 ETH | 50 LINK' instead of mixing currencies

This ensures the fix scales properly for any number of different currencies
and maintains BATS requirement of never mixing different asset types.

## Key Features
- **Multi-blockchain support**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens
- **4-step investigation workflow**: Setup â†’ Victims â†’ Hops â†’ Analysis
- **Thread tracking system**: Uses V-T-H notation (Victim-Transaction-Hop)
- **Real-time validation**: Validates traced amounts against ART (Available Running Total)
- **Wallet entity detection**: Identifies known exchanges and services
- **Export capabilities**: Multiple formats for investigation reports
- **Undo system**: Supports up to 20 undo states
- **Auto-save functionality**: File system integration

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support
