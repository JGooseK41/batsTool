**Message:** Fix critical currency mixing bug in victim transaction totals

- Fixed bug where ETH and LINK (or any different currencies) were being added together
- Properly calculate and display totals by currency separately
- Show '2.653457 ETH | 408.943 LINK' instead of incorrect '411.595457 ETH'
- Updated victim header and table footer to show proper multi-currency totals
- Each currency is now tracked and displayed independently as required by BATS
