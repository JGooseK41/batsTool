**Commit:** 6a44eb2febe9cede3a78651de048c0470ff39205
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Update B.A.T.S. training to emphasize documentation over identical results

- Changed key benefit from "Reproducible Results" to "Defensible Decisions"
- Added Professional Judgment section explaining areas requiring judgment calls
- Introduced LIFO as an alternative to PIFO method with proper documentation
- Clarified that different investigators may reach different conclusions
- Emphasized that the framework ensures clear articulation of decisions
- Added FAQ about investigator conclusions
- Updated throughout to reflect that B.A.T.S. provides a framework for clear documentation rather than guaranteeing identical results

This better reflects the reality that trained investigators use professional judgment while maintaining mathematical certainty in their documentation.
