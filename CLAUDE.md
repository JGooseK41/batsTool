**Commit:** 8803873f574f4e6ab8d42b8894cbe6220f3d744e
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Phase 2 Implementation - Part 1: 3 Fixes Complete (3/16)

ðŸŽ¯ MEDIUM FIX #1: Thread Allocation Validation Gap (COMPLETE)
âœ… Added under-allocation detection to applyPIFOAllocation()
âœ… Returns detailed allocation metrics (total available, allocated, under-allocated)
âœ… Updated all 5 call sites to use new return format
âœ… Added warning banner in wizard Step 2 when under-allocation detected
âœ… Shows exact amounts remaining in each thread
âœ… Provides guidance on partial tracing best practices

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Modified applyPIFOAllocation() return value (lines 32026-32036)
  - Now returns object with allocations + metrics
  - Tracks totalAvailable, totalAllocated, underAllocated
  - hasUnderAllocation flag for easy checking
- Updated 5 call sites (lines 30079, 31953, 32050, 33885, 33904)
  - Extract allocations from result object
  - Store allocationInfo in wizardData for warnings
- Added warning banner in wizard Step 2 (lines 30139-30156)
  - Shows when threads not fully allocated
  - Lists exact remaining amounts per thread
  - Explains partial tracing use cases

BENEFIT:
Before: No warning when threads under-utilized - easy to miss untraced funds
After: Clear warning shows remaining amounts with actionable guidance
Result: Prevents accidental incomplete tracing

---

ðŸŽ¯ MEDIUM FIX #8: Partial Allocation Documentation (COMPLETE)
âœ… Enhanced partial trace notes with detailed remaining amounts
âœ… Automatically lists which threads have remainders
âœ… Shows exact amounts remaining in each source thread
âœ… Integrates with under-allocation detection

IMPLEMENTATION (lines 33942-33971):
- Enhanced partialTraceNote generation
- Added check for allocationInfo.hasUnderAllocation
- Iterates through selected threads to calculate remainders
- Formats remaining amounts per thread
- Appends to entry notes automatically

BENEFIT:
Before: "Partial trace: Following X of Y total" (generic)
After: "Partial trace: Following X of Y total
       Remaining in source threads: 5 BTC remains in V1-T1; 2 BTC remains in V2-T1"
Result: Complete audit trail of all unallocated amounts

---

ðŸŽ¯ LOW FIX #3: Bridge Transactions Marked in Reports (COMPLETE)
âœ… Bridge entries now show chain information in reports
âœ… Displays source â†’ destination chain for bridge transactions
âœ… Clear ðŸŒ‰ bridge emoji marker for visual identification
âœ… Works with bridgeDetails when available

IMPLEMENTATION (lines 37562-37585):
- Modified hop documentation table generation
- Enhanced classification column for bridge entries
- Shows "ðŸŒ‰ (Bridge: Ethereum â†’ Arbitrum)" format
- Falls back to generic "ðŸŒ‰ (Bridge Transaction)" if details missing
- Integrates with existing bridgeDetails structure

BENEFIT:
Before: Bridge entries look like normal transfers
After: Clear chain transition markers in reports
Result: Easy identification of cross-chain movements in documentation

---

PROGRESS: 3/16 Phase 2 Fixes Complete (18.75%)
âœ… Medium severity: 2/11 complete
âœ… Low severity: 1/5 complete

REMAINING:
- 9 Medium-severity fixes
- 4 Low-severity fixes

Next batch: Cluster-related fixes and cache invalidation

## Key Features

- âœ… One-click add to existing hop
- âœ… Auto-detects correct hop from wallet
- âœ… Uses LIBR-calculated traced amount
- âœ… Auto-updates monitored proceeds
- âœ… Timestamped audit trail in notes
- âœ… Option to defer tracing decision
- âœ… **NEW:** Optional verification modal for transparency
- âœ… **NEW:** Prominent methodology selection with info modals
- âœ… Smooth navigation with visual feedback
- âœ… Maintains data integrity

## Integration with LIBR Methodology

**Proper LIBR workflow now complete:**

1. Run LIBR analysis â†’ Find drops
2. Click "Follow & Trace" â†’ Add to hop
3. Monitored amount auto-reduces
4. Re-analyze later â†’ Uses new threshold
5. Find next drops â†’ Add to same hop
6. Repeat until all traced or remains stable

**Hop 1 stays "open" and can receive entries anytime the monitored
wallet has new activity, maintaining proper LIBR accounting.**

## Files Modified

- index.html:
  * Line 35962: Updated displayLIBRAnalysisResults signature
  * Line 35959: Pass walletAddress, blockchain to display
  * Lines 36006-36023: Auto-detect target hop number
  * Lines 36032-36067: Add action buttons to each transaction
  * Lines 36590-36714: LIBR transaction action functions

## Key Features
- **Multi-blockchain support**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and 30+ EVM chains including Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Unichain, Sonic, Abstract, Memecore, Sophon, Berachain, plus Tron, XRP, Sui, and Solana
- **4-step investigation workflow**: Setup â†’ Victims â†’ Hops â†’ Analysis
- **Thread tracking system**: Uses V-T-H notation (Victim-Transaction-Hop)
- **Real-time validation**: Validates traced amounts against ART (Available Running Total)
- **Wallet entity detection**: Identifies known exchanges and services
- **Export capabilities**: Multiple formats for investigation reports
- **Undo system**: Supports up to 20 undo states
- **Auto-save functionality**: File system integration

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## API Integration Status

### Available APIs
- **Mempool.space** (FREE): Transaction lookups, address validation, fee estimates
  - Note: Website has excellent autocomplete, API has backend support but endpoint not fully documented
- **Blockchain.info** (FREE): Bitcoin addresses and transactions
- **BlockCypher** (FREE limited): Multi-chain support with rate limits
- **Arkham Intelligence** (API key): Best for Bitcoin attribution and entity identification
- **Etherscan** (API key): EVM chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
- **TronGrid** (API key): Tron blockchain

### Address Search Strategy
The address search tool uses multiple fallback strategies:
1. Mempool.space (experimental endpoints for prefix search)
2. Arkham Intelligence (best for attribution and partial matches)
3. Complete address validation (Mempool, Blockchain.info)
4. BlockCypher (if API key available)
5. Known address database (major exchanges)

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support
- Investigate Mempool.space undocumented search endpoints

## Implementation Plan - Core Behavior Fixes

### Phase 1: Thread Management & Allocation
1. âœ… Implement PIFO (Proceeds In First Out) allocation
   - Auto-allocate using V1-T1 before V2-T1, etc.
   - Document allocation in entry notes
   - Allow manual override for matching specific transactions

2. â¬œ Fix change address handling
   - Funds returning to sender address stay in original thread
   - Don't create new hop for change outputs
   - Properly detect change vs. payment outputs

3. â¬œ Implement allocation validation
   - Hard block if total allocation exceeds available threads
   - Allow partial tracing (trace portion of larger transaction)
   - Validate before entry creation

### Phase 2: Notation & Display
4. â¬œ Update commingling notation format
   - Use parentheses: `(V1-T1) (V2-T1) H2`
   - Multiple transactions: `(V1-T2,3) (V2-T1,2,4) H3`
   - Keep notation unchanged through swaps

5. â¬œ Make thread review modal optional
   - Add setting to disable/enable
   - Only show if warnings/issues detected
   - Remove automatic popup on hop completion

### Phase 3: Validation & Constraints
6. â¬œ Enforce victim completion workflow
   - Require completion before adding new victim
   - Allow reopening before root total generation
   - Maintain green summary view for completed victims

7. â¬œ Update write-off behavior
   - Reduce ART (Adjusted Root Total) on hop close
   - Not immediately on entry
   - Track write-offs separately in totals

### Phase 4: Transaction Handling
8. â¬œ Fix ERC-20/gas fee handling
   - Ignore ETH gas unless ETH is source thread
   - Filter by tracked currency only
   - No multi-output selection for single token transfers

9. â¬œ Manual entry flexibility
   - Don't require transaction hash for off-chain
   - Allow CEX internal transfers
   - Support incomplete transaction data

### Testing Scenarios
- Simple linear flow (1 victim â†’ 3 hops)
- Commingling (multiple victims â†’ merged hop)
- Split threads (one thread â†’ multiple outputs)
- DEX swaps (currency conversion)
- Complex combination flows
