**Commit:** 13e9872403a8a12163ca6ce5fca03f8ca9c0593e
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Add HTTPS enforcement and security features

- Added automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect in JavaScript
- Added visual security indicators:
  - Yellow warning banner for file:// protocol with limited functionality notice
  - Green secure connection indicator for HTTPS (auto-hides after 5 seconds)
- Added comprehensive deployment section to training materials
- Created .htaccess file for Apache servers with:
  - HTTPS enforcement rules
  - Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
  - Access restrictions for sensitive files
  - Performance optimizations (compression, caching)
- Warning message links to deployment instructions in training materials

This ensures users are aware of security requirements and provides clear guidance for proper deployment.
