**Commit:** 38e3ce6f4dd80670661afb9d9832920d2717cdaa
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Upgrade to Etherscan API v2 and add multi-chain support

- Migrate from Etherscan API v1 to v2 for better rate limits
- Add support for multiple EVM chains: Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain
- Create shared EVM response parser for all EVM-compatible chains
- All chains use single Etherscan API key through v2 endpoint
- Note: Chain detection from address not possible for EVM chains (all use 0x)

## Key Features
- **Multi-blockchain support**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens
- **4-step investigation workflow**: Setup â†’ Victims â†’ Hops â†’ Analysis
- **Thread tracking system**: Uses V-T-H notation (Victim-Transaction-Hop)
- **Real-time validation**: Validates traced amounts against ART (Available Running Total)
- **Wallet entity detection**: Identifies known exchanges and services
- **Export capabilities**: Multiple formats for investigation reports
- **Undo system**: Supports up to 20 undo states
- **Auto-save functionality**: File system integration

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support
