**Commit:** 9524daec192d70f6cff85f41d0a1e6a305452c34
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Critical Fix: Write-off and cold storage thread allocation

Fixes two critical bugs that broke hop finalization and thread tracking:

## BUG #1: Missing writeOffAmount() Function
**Problem**: Write-off button called undefined function writeOffAmount()
**Impact**: Users could not write off leftover amounts to close hops
**Error**: "Uncaught ReferenceError: writeOffAmount is not defined"

**Fix**:
- Created writeOffAmount() wrapper function (line 22758)
- Enhanced createMaxWriteoff() to properly allocate from available threads
- Added individualSourceAssignments tracking
- Set writeoffApplied: false flag (applied when hop closes per spec)

## BUG #2: Cold Storage Threads Not Consumed
**Problem**: Marking thread as cold storage didn't consume it from available threads
**Impact**: Cold storage threads incorrectly appeared as available in next hop
**Root Cause**: Missing individualSourceAssignments field - system didn't know which threads to deduct

**Fix**:
- Enhanced markAsColdStorage() to allocate from available threads (lines 29032-29146)
- Enhanced markAsVASPArrival() with same fix (lines 29150-29217)
- Both now:
  * Call getAvailableSourcesForHop() to get available threads
  * Allocate amount using PIFO order (first available used first)
  * Set individualSourceAssignments with thread ID â†’ amount mapping
  * Mark as isTerminalWallet: true to prevent output thread creation
  * Call buildAvailableThreadsIndex() to apply consumption

## TECHNICAL DETAILS:

**Thread Allocation Logic** (Applied to all 3 functions):
```javascript
const availableThreads = getAvailableSourcesForHop(hopNumber, currency);
const individualSourceAssignments = {};
let remainingToAllocate = amount;

for (const thread of availableThreads) {
    if (remainingToAllocate <= 0) break;
    const amountFromThread = Math.min(thread.availableAmount, remainingToAllocate);
    if (amountFromThread > 0) {
        const threadKey = thread.internalId || thread.threadId;
        individualSourceAssignments[threadKey] = amountFromThread;
        remainingToAllocate -= amountFromThread;
    }
}
```

**Why individualSourceAssignments is Critical**:
The buildAvailableThreadsIndex() function (lines 10218-10258) checks for this field:
- If present: Deducts allocated amounts from source threads
- If missing: Threads remain at full availability (BUG)

**Terminal Wallet Handling**:
- Cold storage and VASP entries now set isTerminalWallet: true
- buildAvailableThreadsIndex() respects this at line 10264-10341
- Terminal entries consume source threads but don't create output threads
- This prevents ghost threads from appearing in subsequent hops

## FILES MODIFIED:
- index.html:
  * Lines 22679-22760: createMaxWriteoff() enhanced + writeOffAmount() added
  * Lines 29032-29146: markAsColdStorage() enhanced
  * Lines 29150-29217: markAsVASPArrival() enhanced

## TESTING SCENARIOS:

**Write-off Test**:
1. Create hop with leftover amount
2. Click "Write Off" button â†’ âœ… Works (previously crashed)
3. Check available threads â†’ âœ… Properly reduced
4. Hop can now be closed

**Cold Storage Test**:
1. Mark thread as cold storage in Hop 1 â†’ âœ… Entry created
2. Check available threads in Hop 2 â†’ âœ… Thread NOT available
3. Previously: Thread incorrectly showed as available

**VASP Arrival Test**:
1. Mark funds as arriving at exchange â†’ âœ… Allocates properly
2. Threads consumed correctly â†’ âœ… No ghost threads

## IMPACT:
- âœ… Write-off functionality restored
- âœ… Cold storage workflow fixed
- âœ… Thread accounting accurate
- âœ… Hop finalization works correctly
- âœ… No more ghost threads in available sources

## Key Features

- âœ… One-click add to existing hop
- âœ… Auto-detects correct hop from wallet
- âœ… Uses LIBR-calculated traced amount
- âœ… Auto-updates monitored proceeds
- âœ… Timestamped audit trail in notes
- âœ… Option to defer tracing decision
- âœ… **NEW:** Optional verification modal for transparency
- âœ… **NEW:** Prominent methodology selection with info modals
- âœ… Smooth navigation with visual feedback
- âœ… Maintains data integrity

## Integration with LIBR Methodology

**Proper LIBR workflow now complete:**

1. Run LIBR analysis â†’ Find drops
2. Click "Follow & Trace" â†’ Add to hop
3. Monitored amount auto-reduces
4. Re-analyze later â†’ Uses new threshold
5. Find next drops â†’ Add to same hop
6. Repeat until all traced or remains stable

**Hop 1 stays "open" and can receive entries anytime the monitored
wallet has new activity, maintaining proper LIBR accounting.**

- **Undo system**: Supports up to 20 undo states
- **Auto-save functionality**: File system integration

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## API Integration Status

### Available APIs
- **Mempool.space** (FREE): Transaction lookups, address validation, fee estimates
  - Note: Website has excellent autocomplete, API has backend support but endpoint not fully documented
- **Blockchain.info** (FREE): Bitcoin addresses and transactions
- **BlockCypher** (FREE limited): Multi-chain support with rate limits
- **Arkham Intelligence** (API key): Best for Bitcoin attribution and entity identification
- **Etherscan** (API key): EVM chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
- **TronGrid** (API key): Tron blockchain

### Address Search Strategy
The address search tool uses multiple fallback strategies:
1. Mempool.space (experimental endpoints for prefix search)
2. Arkham Intelligence (best for attribution and partial matches)
3. Complete address validation (Mempool, Blockchain.info)
4. BlockCypher (if API key available)
5. Known address database (major exchanges)

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support
- Investigate Mempool.space undocumented search endpoints

## Implementation Plan - Core Behavior Fixes

### Phase 1: Thread Management & Allocation
1. âœ… Implement PIFO (Proceeds In First Out) allocation
   - Auto-allocate using V1-T1 before V2-T1, etc.
   - Document allocation in entry notes
   - Allow manual override for matching specific transactions

2. â¬œ Fix change address handling
   - Funds returning to sender address stay in original thread
   - Don't create new hop for change outputs
   - Properly detect change vs. payment outputs

3. â¬œ Implement allocation validation
   - Hard block if total allocation exceeds available threads
   - Allow partial tracing (trace portion of larger transaction)
   - Validate before entry creation

### Phase 2: Notation & Display
4. â¬œ Update commingling notation format
   - Use parentheses: `(V1-T1) (V2-T1) H2`
   - Multiple transactions: `(V1-T2,3) (V2-T1,2,4) H3`
   - Keep notation unchanged through swaps

5. â¬œ Make thread review modal optional
   - Add setting to disable/enable
   - Only show if warnings/issues detected
   - Remove automatic popup on hop completion

### Phase 3: Validation & Constraints
6. â¬œ Enforce victim completion workflow
   - Require completion before adding new victim
   - Allow reopening before root total generation
   - Maintain green summary view for completed victims

7. â¬œ Update write-off behavior
   - Reduce ART (Adjusted Root Total) on hop close
   - Not immediately on entry
   - Track write-offs separately in totals

### Phase 4: Transaction Handling
8. â¬œ Fix ERC-20/gas fee handling
   - Ignore ETH gas unless ETH is source thread
   - Filter by tracked currency only
   - No multi-output selection for single token transfers

9. â¬œ Manual entry flexibility
   - Don't require transaction hash for off-chain
   - Allow CEX internal transfers
   - Support incomplete transaction data

### Testing Scenarios
- Simple linear flow (1 victim â†’ 3 hops)
- Commingling (multiple victims â†’ merged hop)
- Split threads (one thread â†’ multiple outputs)
- DEX swaps (currency conversion)
- Complex combination flows
