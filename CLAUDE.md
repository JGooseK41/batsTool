**Message:** Improve hop entry workflow with wizard and better button explanations

- Added step-by-step wizard for hop trace entries:
  - Step 1: Select source threads
  - Step 2: Allocate amounts from each thread
  - Step 3: Enter transaction hash and lookup details
- Wizard is dismissible with "Don't show again" preference
- Added clear explanations for Smart Amount Allocation vs Max buttons:
  - Smart Allocation: For tracing specific total amounts across multiple sources
  - Max button: For quickly allocating all available funds
- Fixed workflow to select threads and amounts before entering transaction hash
