**Message:** Fix utility tools accessibility from landing page

- Updated openPKConverter() and openAddressFinder() to ensure modals display properly
- Set z-index to 10000 for modals to appear above landing page
- Added null checks to prevent errors when elements don't exist
- Fixed modal display issues so tools are accessible without entering the app

The PK Converter and Address Finder tools can now be opened directly from the landing page cards.
