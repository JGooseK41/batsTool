**Commit:** 0f263befbb2ea269f46ff0e6b5991b330489cfc2
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Implement UTC timezone compliance for all reports

- Convert all report timestamps to UTC format for consistency
- Add formatDateTimeForReport function for UTC conversion
- Update HTML report generation to display all times in UTC
- Update CSV export to use UTC timestamps
- Add UTC conversion for wallet "First Seen" dates
- Add UTC compliance note to report header
- Ensure all depositDate, timestamp fields show UTC time

All timestamps in reports now display as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC"
for regulatory compliance and consistency across timezones.

- **Wallet entity detection**: Identifies known exchanges and services
- **Export capabilities**: Multiple formats for investigation reports
- **Undo system**: Supports up to 20 undo states
- **Auto-save functionality**: File system integration

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support
