**Commit:** 4295dde5c5c55caea88b406c4892cc65fcb6d94d
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Fix SSL certificate mismatch and improve domain handling

- Updated HTTPS enforcement to handle multiple trusted domains
- Added batstool.com to trusted domains list
- Created netlify.toml configuration file with:
  - Proper redirect rules for HTTPS enforcement
  - Security headers configuration
  - Cache control settings
  - CSP policy allowing required external APIs
- Made HTTPS redirect more intelligent (skip for localhost)
- Added domain validation to prevent redirect loops

To complete SSL setup:
1. Add batstool.com as custom domain in Netlify dashboard
2. Wait for automatic SSL certificate provisioning (5-15 mins)
3. Ensure DNS points to Netlify servers

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support
