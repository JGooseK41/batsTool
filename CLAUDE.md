**Message:** Add entry type selection wizard for better UX

- Replaced dropdown + button with single "Add New Entry" button
- Created visual wizard showing all entry types with icons and descriptions
- Each entry type has clear explanation of when to use it

- Cleaner, more intuitive interface for adding hop entries
