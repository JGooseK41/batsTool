## Project Overview
B.A.T.S. (Block Audit Tracing Standard) is a blockchain investigation tool for tracing cryptocurrency transactions across multiple chains. It helps investigators track stolen or illicit funds using a standardized notation system.

**Commit:** 5332e67dfcfd1130349192535af6239cfbf87d02
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Fix: Wallet explorer crash from nested thread structure in ART tracking

Problem: When clicking asset in wallet explorer, got error:
"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'notation')"
at initializeARTTracking line 15808

Root Cause:
Three more functions still using old nested structure:
1. initializeARTTracking() (lines 15804-15815)
2. quickWriteOffThread() (lines 24046-24052)
3. quickColdStorageThread() (lines 24134-24140)

All tried to iterate like:
```javascript
for (const curr in availableThreads) {
    for (const threadKey in availableThreads[curr]) {
        const thread = availableThreads[curr][threadKey];
```

With flat structure, first loop gets internal IDs (not currencies), so:
- curr = "V1-T1_USDT" (thread ID, not currency)
- availableThreads[curr] = thread object
- Second loop iterates thread properties (notation, currency, etc.)
- availableThreads[curr][threadKey] = "V1-T1" (property value, not thread)
- Trying to read .notation from string/null â†’ crash

Solution:
Migrated all three functions to flat structure:
```javascript
for (const internalId in availableThreads) {
    const thread = availableThreads[internalId];
    if (!thread) continue;
    if (thread.notation === threadId || internalId === threadId) {
        currency = thread.currency; // Get from thread object
```

Now wallet explorer:
- Loads asset list correctly âœ“
- Displays transactions when asset clicked âœ“
- Initializes ART tracking without crash âœ“
- Quick actions (write-off, cold storage) work âœ“

## Key Features

- âœ… One-click add to existing hop
- âœ… Auto-detects correct hop from wallet
- âœ… Uses LIBR-calculated traced amount
- âœ… Auto-updates monitored proceeds
- âœ… Timestamped audit trail in notes
- âœ… Option to defer tracing decision
- âœ… **NEW:** Optional verification modal for transparency
- âœ… **NEW:** Prominent methodology selection with info modals
- âœ… Smooth navigation with visual feedback
- âœ… Maintains data integrity

## Integration with LIBR Methodology

**Proper LIBR workflow now complete:**

1. Run LIBR analysis â†’ Find drops
2. Click "Follow & Trace" â†’ Add to hop
3. Monitored amount auto-reduces
4. Re-analyze later â†’ Uses new threshold
5. Find next drops â†’ Add to same hop
6. Repeat until all traced or remains stable

**Hop 1 stays "open" and can receive entries anytime the monitored
wallet has new activity, maintaining proper LIBR accounting.**

## Files Modified

- index.html:
  * Line 35962: Updated displayLIBRAnalysisResults signature
  * Line 35959: Pass walletAddress, blockchain to display
  * Lines 36006-36023: Auto-detect target hop number
  * Lines 36032-36067: Add action buttons to each transaction
  * Lines 36590-36714: LIBR transaction action functions

## Key Features
- **Multi-blockchain support**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and 30+ EVM chains including Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Unichain, Sonic, Abstract, Memecore, Sophon, Berachain, plus Tron, XRP, Sui, and Solana
- **4-step investigation workflow**: Setup â†’ Victims â†’ Hops â†’ Analysis
- **Thread tracking system**: Uses V-T-H notation (Victim-Transaction-Hop)
- **Real-time validation**: Validates traced amounts against ART (Available Running Total)
- **Wallet entity detection**: Identifies known exchanges and services
- **Export capabilities**: Multiple formats for investigation reports
- **Undo system**: Supports up to 20 undo states
- **Auto-save functionality**: File system integration

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## API Integration Status

### Available APIs
- **Mempool.space** (FREE): Transaction lookups, address validation, fee estimates
  - Note: Website has excellent autocomplete, API has backend support but endpoint not fully documented
- **Blockchain.info** (FREE): Bitcoin addresses and transactions
- **BlockCypher** (FREE limited): Multi-chain support with rate limits
- **Arkham Intelligence** (API key): Best for Bitcoin attribution and entity identification
- **Etherscan** (API key): EVM chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
- **TronGrid** (API key): Tron blockchain

### Address Search Strategy
The address search tool uses multiple fallback strategies:
1. Mempool.space (experimental endpoints for prefix search)
2. Arkham Intelligence (best for attribution and partial matches)
3. Complete address validation (Mempool, Blockchain.info)
4. BlockCypher (if API key available)
5. Known address database (major exchanges)

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support
- Investigate Mempool.space undocumented search endpoints

## Implementation Plan - Core Behavior Fixes

### Phase 1: Thread Management & Allocation
1. âœ… Implement PIFO (Proceeds In First Out) allocation
   - Auto-allocate using V1-T1 before V2-T1, etc.
   - Document allocation in entry notes
   - Allow manual override for matching specific transactions

2. â¬œ Fix change address handling
   - Funds returning to sender address stay in original thread
   - Don't create new hop for change outputs
   - Properly detect change vs. payment outputs

3. â¬œ Implement allocation validation
   - Hard block if total allocation exceeds available threads
   - Allow partial tracing (trace portion of larger transaction)
   - Validate before entry creation

### Phase 2: Notation & Display
4. â¬œ Update commingling notation format
   - Use parentheses: `(V1-T1) (V2-T1) H2`
   - Multiple transactions: `(V1-T2,3) (V2-T1,2,4) H3`
   - Keep notation unchanged through swaps

5. â¬œ Make thread review modal optional
   - Add setting to disable/enable
   - Only show if warnings/issues detected
   - Remove automatic popup on hop completion

### Phase 3: Validation & Constraints
6. â¬œ Enforce victim completion workflow
   - Require completion before adding new victim
   - Allow reopening before root total generation
   - Maintain green summary view for completed victims

7. â¬œ Update write-off behavior
   - Reduce ART (Adjusted Root Total) on hop close
   - Not immediately on entry
   - Track write-offs separately in totals

### Phase 4: Transaction Handling
8. â¬œ Fix ERC-20/gas fee handling
   - Ignore ETH gas unless ETH is source thread
   - Filter by tracked currency only
   - No multi-output selection for single token transfers

9. â¬œ Manual entry flexibility
   - Don't require transaction hash for off-chain
   - Allow CEX internal transfers
   - Support incomplete transaction data

### Testing Scenarios
- Simple linear flow (1 victim â†’ 3 hops)
- Commingling (multiple victims â†’ merged hop)
- Split threads (one thread â†’ multiple outputs)
- DEX swaps (currency conversion)
- Complex combination flows
