**Message:** Feature: Batch entry logging workflow in Wallet Explorer

✨ UX ENHANCEMENT: Queue multiple entries and log them all at once

USER REQUEST: "there also needs to be a way when you get back to the hop
entry builder after making all your selections in the wallet explorer that
you can click one button to log all entries created from in the wallet
explorer. Maybe a button at the bottom of the wallet explorer that says
return to hop builder then when you click that a pop up asks if you want
to log all entries you created in the wallet explorer"

PROBLEM:

When building entries wallet-by-wallet, investigators had to:
1. Create entry → Return to hops → Verify
2. Go back to wallet → Create another entry → Return → Verify
3. Repeat for each transaction

This was tedious and broke the flow. No way to review all entries together
before logging them to the investigation.

SOLUTION:

New batch workflow where entries are queued in the wallet explorer, then
logged all at once with a confirmation modal showing all pending entries.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Pending Entries Tracking (lines 14336, 14660):
   - Added pendingEntries[] array to walletExplorerState
   - Tracks all entries created during wallet explorer session
   - Cleared on wallet close or after batch confirmation

2. Return to Hop Builder Button (lines 2995-2997):
   - Hidden by default
   - Shows when pendingEntries.length > 0
   - Displays count: "✅ Return to Hop Builder (N entries)"
   - Green styling to indicate ready to proceed

3. Modified "Create & Stay" Workflow (lines 17287-17327):
   - No longer creates entry immediately
   - Adds entry to pendingEntries array
   - Shows notification with total count
   - Updates Return button visibility
   - Updates thread progression panel
   - Grays out transaction in table

4. Batch Confirmation Modal (lines 3046-3093):
   - Shows summary: total count + destination hop
   - Lists all pending entries with details:
     * Entry type (trace/writeoff) with color coding
     * Amount and currency
     * From/To addresses
     * Thread assignment
     * Transaction hash
   - Warning about permanent addition
   - Buttons: Cancel or "Log All N Entries"

5. Supporting Functions:
   - updateReturnButton() (lines 17364-17375)
     * Shows/hides button based on pending count
     * Updates count display

   - returnToHopBuilder() (lines 17377-17445)
     * Validates pending entries exist
     * Populates batch confirmation modal
     * Shows entry cards with color-coded types

   - confirmBatchEntries() (lines 17452-17503)
     * Adds all pending entries to hop
     * Sorts chronologically
     * Saves and renders
     * Closes all modals
     * Scrolls to hop
     * Clears pending entries

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WORKFLOW:

Old (Multiple Round Trips):
1. Open wallet explorer
2. Select transaction → Create entry → Return to hops
3. Verify entry in hop
4. Open wallet explorer again
5. Select another transaction → Create entry → Return to hops
6. Repeat...

New (Batch Workflow):
1. Open wallet explorer
2. Select transaction → "Create & Stay in Explorer"
3. Entry queued (1 total)
4. Select another transaction → "Create & Stay in Explorer"
5. Entry queued (2 total)
6. Select more transactions...
7. Click "Return to Hop Builder (5 entries)"
8. Review ALL 5 entries in confirmation modal
9. Click "Log All 5 Entries"
10. All entries added at once ✅
11. Return to hop builder to see results

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXAMPLE:

Investigating wallet with 10 outbound transactions:

User workflow:
1. Open wallet via "View & Trace" button
2. Select first OUT tx → "Create & Stay" → Queued (1)
3. Select second OUT tx → "Create & Stay" → Queued (2)
4. Select third OUT tx → "Create & Stay" → Queued (3)
5. ... continue for all 10 transactions
6. Button shows: "Return to Hop Builder (10 entries)"
7. Click button → Modal shows all 10 entries
8. Review: 8 traces + 2 write-offs
9. Click "Log All 10 Entries"
10. All entries added to Hop 2 at once
11. Return to hop view to verify
12. Done! ✨

VS Old Workflow:
- Would require 10 separate create/return/verify cycles
- Easy to lose track of progress
- No way to review all together

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BENEFITS:

✅ Wallet-by-wallet workflow fully supported
✅ Queue unlimited entries before logging
✅ Review all entries together before confirming
✅ Single click to log all entries at once
✅ Clear count of pending entries
✅ Color-coded entry types in confirmation
✅ Prevents accidental partial logging
✅ Maintains all existing validation
✅ Thread progression updates in real-time
✅ Transactions gray out as entries are queued

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:

✅ "Create & Return to Hops" still works (immediate create)
✅ Existing workflows unchanged
✅ Pending entries cleared on wallet close
✅ No impact on other entry creation methods

TESTING:
- Open wallet explorer with source thread
- Create 3-5 entries using "Create & Stay"
- Verify button shows with correct count
- Click "Return to Hop Builder"
- Verify all entries shown in modal
- Click "Log All N Entries"
- Verify all entries added to hop
- Verify entries sorted chronologically

## Key Features

- ✅ One-click add to existing hop
- ✅ Auto-detects correct hop from wallet
- ✅ Uses LIBR-calculated traced amount
- ✅ Auto-updates monitored proceeds
- ✅ Timestamped audit trail in notes
- ✅ Option to defer tracing decision
- ✅ **NEW:** Optional verification modal for transparency
- ✅ **NEW:** Prominent methodology selection with info modals
- ✅ Smooth navigation with visual feedback
- ✅ Maintains data integrity

## Integration with LIBR Methodology

**Proper LIBR workflow now complete:**

1. Run LIBR analysis → Find drops
2. Click "Follow & Trace" → Add to hop
3. Monitored amount auto-reduces
4. Re-analyze later → Uses new threshold
5. Find next drops → Add to same hop
6. Repeat until all traced or remains stable

**Hop 1 stays "open" and can receive entries anytime the monitored
wallet has new activity, maintaining proper LIBR accounting.**

## Files Modified

## Key Features
- **Multi-blockchain support**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and 30+ EVM chains including Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Unichain, Sonic, Abstract, Memecore, Sophon, Berachain, plus Tron, XRP, Sui, and Solana
- **4-step investigation workflow**: Setup → Victims → Hops → Analysis
- **Thread tracking system**: Uses V-T-H notation (Victim-Transaction-Hop)
- **Real-time validation**: Validates traced amounts against ART (Available Running Total)
- **Wallet entity detection**: Identifies known exchanges and services
- **Export capabilities**: Multiple formats for investigation reports
- **Undo system**: Supports up to 20 undo states
- **Auto-save functionality**: File system integration

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## API Integration Status

### Available APIs
- **Mempool.space** (FREE): Transaction lookups, address validation, fee estimates
  - Note: Website has excellent autocomplete, API has backend support but endpoint not fully documented
- **Blockchain.info** (FREE): Bitcoin addresses and transactions
- **BlockCypher** (FREE limited): Multi-chain support with rate limits
- **Arkham Intelligence** (API key): Best for Bitcoin attribution and entity identification
- **Etherscan** (API key): EVM chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
- **TronGrid** (API key): Tron blockchain

### Address Search Strategy
The address search tool uses multiple fallback strategies:
1. Mempool.space (experimental endpoints for prefix search)
2. Arkham Intelligence (best for attribution and partial matches)
3. Complete address validation (Mempool, Blockchain.info)
4. BlockCypher (if API key available)
5. Known address database (major exchanges)

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support
- Investigate Mempool.space undocumented search endpoints

## Implementation Plan - Core Behavior Fixes

### Phase 1: Thread Management & Allocation
1. ✅ Implement PIFO (Proceeds In First Out) allocation
   - Auto-allocate using V1-T1 before V2-T1, etc.
   - Document allocation in entry notes
   - Allow manual override for matching specific transactions

2. ⬜ Fix change address handling
   - Funds returning to sender address stay in original thread
   - Don't create new hop for change outputs
   - Properly detect change vs. payment outputs

3. ⬜ Implement allocation validation
   - Hard block if total allocation exceeds available threads
   - Allow partial tracing (trace portion of larger transaction)
   - Validate before entry creation

### Phase 2: Notation & Display
4. ⬜ Update commingling notation format
   - Use parentheses: `(V1-T1) (V2-T1) H2`
   - Multiple transactions: `(V1-T2,3) (V2-T1,2,4) H3`
   - Keep notation unchanged through swaps

5. ⬜ Make thread review modal optional
   - Add setting to disable/enable
   - Only show if warnings/issues detected
   - Remove automatic popup on hop completion

### Phase 3: Validation & Constraints
6. ⬜ Enforce victim completion workflow
   - Require completion before adding new victim
   - Allow reopening before root total generation
   - Maintain green summary view for completed victims

7. ⬜ Update write-off behavior
   - Reduce ART (Adjusted Root Total) on hop close
   - Not immediately on entry
   - Track write-offs separately in totals

### Phase 4: Transaction Handling
8. ⬜ Fix ERC-20/gas fee handling
   - Ignore ETH gas unless ETH is source thread
   - Filter by tracked currency only
   - No multi-output selection for single token transfers

9. ⬜ Manual entry flexibility
   - Don't require transaction hash for off-chain
   - Allow CEX internal transfers
   - Support incomplete transaction data

### Testing Scenarios
- Simple linear flow (1 victim → 3 hops)
- Commingling (multiple victims → merged hop)
- Split threads (one thread → multiple outputs)
- DEX swaps (currency conversion)
- Complex combination flows
