# B.A.T.S. Tool - Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview
B.A.T.S. (Block Audit Tracing Standard) is a blockchain investigation tool for tracing cryptocurrency transactions across multiple chains. It helps investigators track stolen or illicit funds using a standardized notation system.

**Commit:** ee8ce28993c2bbdf91896bdc0ede8dddc7337021
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Enable same-hop swap tracing - swap outputs immediately available within same hop

- Swap outputs are now available for tracing immediately within the same hop
- After swapping USDC to USDT in hop 2, you can trace USDT in hop 2 without advancing
- getAvailableSourcesForHop now checks both previous hop AND current hop for swaps
- Properly hides original threads that have been swapped at any level
- Supports complex flows: trace â†’ swap â†’ trace all within same hop

## Key Features
- **Multi-blockchain support**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens
- **4-step investigation workflow**: Setup â†’ Victims â†’ Hops â†’ Analysis
- **Thread tracking system**: Uses V-T-H notation (Victim-Transaction-Hop)
- **Real-time validation**: Validates traced amounts against ART (Available Running Total)
- **Wallet entity detection**: Identifies known exchanges and services
- **Export capabilities**: Multiple formats for investigation reports
- **Undo system**: Supports up to 20 undo states
- **Auto-save functionality**: File system integration

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support

## Implementation Plan - Core Behavior Fixes

### Phase 1: Thread Management & Allocation
1. âœ… Implement PIFO (Proceeds In First Out) allocation
   - Auto-allocate using V1-T1 before V2-T1, etc.
   - Document allocation in entry notes
   - Allow manual override for matching specific transactions

2. â¬œ Fix change address handling
   - Funds returning to sender address stay in original thread
   - Don't create new hop for change outputs
   - Properly detect change vs. payment outputs

3. â¬œ Implement allocation validation
   - Hard block if total allocation exceeds available threads
   - Allow partial tracing (trace portion of larger transaction)
   - Validate before entry creation

### Phase 2: Notation & Display
4. â¬œ Update commingling notation format
   - Use parentheses: `(V1-T1) (V2-T1) H2`
   - Multiple transactions: `(V1-T2,3) (V2-T1,2,4) H3`
   - Keep notation unchanged through swaps

5. â¬œ Make thread review modal optional
   - Add setting to disable/enable
   - Only show if warnings/issues detected
   - Remove automatic popup on hop completion

### Phase 3: Validation & Constraints
6. â¬œ Enforce victim completion workflow
   - Require completion before adding new victim
   - Allow reopening before root total generation
   - Maintain green summary view for completed victims

7. â¬œ Update write-off behavior
   - Reduce ART (Adjusted Root Total) on hop close
   - Not immediately on entry
   - Track write-offs separately in totals

### Phase 4: Transaction Handling
8. â¬œ Fix ERC-20/gas fee handling
   - Ignore ETH gas unless ETH is source thread
   - Filter by tracked currency only
   - No multi-output selection for single token transfers

9. â¬œ Manual entry flexibility
   - Don't require transaction hash for off-chain
   - Allow CEX internal transfers
   - Support incomplete transaction data

### Testing Scenarios
- Simple linear flow (1 victim â†’ 3 hops)
- Commingling (multiple victims â†’ merged hop)
- Split threads (one thread â†’ multiple outputs)
- DEX swaps (currency conversion)
- Complex combination flows
