**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Add BATS Investigation Graph Structure illustration to training

- Created comprehensive SVG diagram showing the mathematical graph structure
- Illustrates flow from victims through RED, BLACK, YELLOW wallets to terminals
- Shows convergence at YELLOW hub wallet demonstrating criminal consolidation
- Includes mathematical validation box showing how totals are verified
- Added explanatory cards about graph properties (DAG, completeness, traceability)
- Demonstrates V-T-H notation on actual graph edges
- Visual legend for all wallet color classifications
- Shows why the graph structure makes evidence legally defensible

This visual clearly articulates both the reason for the process and how it fundamentally functions as a mathematical proof system.

## Key Features
- **Multi-blockchain support**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens
- **4-step investigation workflow**: Setup â†’ Victims â†’ Hops â†’ Analysis
- **Thread tracking system**: Uses V-T-H notation (Victim-Transaction-Hop)
- **Real-time validation**: Validates traced amounts against ART (Available Running Total)
- **Wallet entity detection**: Identifies known exchanges and services
- **Export capabilities**: Multiple formats for investigation reports
- **Undo system**: Supports up to 20 undo states
- **Auto-save functionality**: File system integration

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support
