**Commit:** ce8dd9fa39f82cf91eb7b4790c5e5ee380df14e6
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Fix LIBR method definition and usage description

- Remove incorrect description that LIBR is used 'when PIFO cannot apply'
- Update to accurate definition: LIBR arrests asset flow and maintains funds in fewer wallets closer to RED wallet
- Add proper use cases:
  - When stablecoin burn and reissue is the goal
  - When investigators may obtain private keys or wallet access through suspect cooperation or compelled assistance
- Remove 'rare exception' label - LIBR is a valid methodological choice
- Change warning notification to info level when selecting LIBR
- Update both training materials and main application

LIBR is not about PIFO failure, but a strategic choice to keep assets concentrated near the victim-facing wallets for specific investigative goals.
