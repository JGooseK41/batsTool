**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Complete wallet classification hierarchy system implementation

- Wallets can now progress UP the criminal hierarchy but never down
- BLACK wallets can change to PINK, YELLOW, or higher levels
- Automatic classification respects hierarchy rules with canChangeWalletClassification()
- Manual classification requires justification and checks hierarchy
- Classification history tracking for audit trail
- Retroactive updates across all entries when classification changes
- Training materials updated to reflect hierarchy progression rules
