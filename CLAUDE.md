# B.A.T.S. Tool - Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview
B.A.T.S. (Block Audit Tracing Standard) is a blockchain investigation tool for tracing cryptocurrency transactions across multiple chains. It helps investigators track stolen or illicit funds using a standardized notation system.

**Commit:** 8feac2a8dd9a2204d370a57cd6eff3d771d9e6f9
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Improve change address detection with automatic and optional modes

- Automatic change detection when output returns to SAME address as sender
  - Automatically classified as change (cannot be changed)
  - Shows 'üîÑ Auto-detected Change (Same Address)' label
  - Radio buttons disabled to prevent misclassification

- Optional change detection for NEW addresses
  - Shows '‚ö†Ô∏è Possible Change (New Address)' for non-round amounts
  - Investigator can choose: Payment (new hop) or Change (same-hop thread)
  - Pre-selected based on amount patterns but fully editable

- UI improvements:
  - Clear distinction between automatic vs suggested change
  - Change creates 'Same-Hop Thread' (not 'Orange Thread')
  - Payment creates 'New Hop' for clarity

This gives investigators full control while automating obvious cases:
- Same address = always change (automatic)
- New address + decimal amount = suggested change (editable)
- New address + round amount = suggested payment (editable)

## Key Features
- **Multi-blockchain support**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens
- **4-step investigation workflow**: Setup ‚Üí Victims ‚Üí Hops ‚Üí Analysis
- **Thread tracking system**: Uses V-T-H notation (Victim-Transaction-Hop)
- **Real-time validation**: Validates traced amounts against ART (Available Running Total)
- **Wallet entity detection**: Identifies known exchanges and services
- **Export capabilities**: Multiple formats for investigation reports
- **Undo system**: Supports up to 20 undo states
- **Auto-save functionality**: File system integration

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support

## Implementation Plan - Core Behavior Fixes

### Phase 1: Thread Management & Allocation
1. ‚úÖ Implement PIFO (Proceeds In First Out) allocation
   - Auto-allocate using V1-T1 before V2-T1, etc.
   - Document allocation in entry notes
   - Allow manual override for matching specific transactions

2. ‚¨ú Fix change address handling
   - Funds returning to sender address stay in original thread
   - Don't create new hop for change outputs
   - Properly detect change vs. payment outputs

3. ‚¨ú Implement allocation validation
   - Hard block if total allocation exceeds available threads
   - Allow partial tracing (trace portion of larger transaction)
   - Validate before entry creation

### Phase 2: Notation & Display
4. ‚¨ú Update commingling notation format
   - Use parentheses: `(V1-T1) (V2-T1) H2`
   - Multiple transactions: `(V1-T2,3) (V2-T1,2,4) H3`
   - Keep notation unchanged through swaps

5. ‚¨ú Make thread review modal optional
   - Add setting to disable/enable
   - Only show if warnings/issues detected
   - Remove automatic popup on hop completion

### Phase 3: Validation & Constraints
6. ‚¨ú Enforce victim completion workflow
   - Require completion before adding new victim
   - Allow reopening before root total generation
   - Maintain green summary view for completed victims

7. ‚¨ú Update write-off behavior
   - Reduce ART (Adjusted Root Total) on hop close
   - Not immediately on entry
   - Track write-offs separately in totals

### Phase 4: Transaction Handling
8. ‚¨ú Fix ERC-20/gas fee handling
   - Ignore ETH gas unless ETH is source thread
   - Filter by tracked currency only
   - No multi-output selection for single token transfers

9. ‚¨ú Manual entry flexibility
   - Don't require transaction hash for off-chain
   - Allow CEX internal transfers
   - Support incomplete transaction data

### Testing Scenarios
- Simple linear flow (1 victim ‚Üí 3 hops)
- Commingling (multiple victims ‚Üí merged hop)
- Split threads (one thread ‚Üí multiple outputs)
- DEX swaps (currency conversion)
- Complex combination flows
