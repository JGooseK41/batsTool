**Message:** Enhance hop entry wizard with manual entry and better control options

- Add manual transaction entry mode in wizard without requiring API lookup
- Add toggle between API Lookup and Manual Entry modes in step 3
- Add "Cancel to Manual" button that transfers wizard data to manual entry form
- Add "Skip This Time" button to skip wizard for current entry only
- Rename "Don't show this wizard again" to clarify it disables for future entries
- Pre-fill manual entry form when canceling wizard with any data already entered
- Manual mode includes fields for tx hash, from/to wallets, and timestamp
- Automatically scroll to and highlight new entry when canceling to manual

These improvements give users more flexibility to use the wizard when helpful while easily bypassing it when needed.
