**Commit:** e53c443ee3fa92ba422ad9c0d4d9b8f6c7ede253
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Fix split source thread assignment blocking issue

Fixed double-counting in getMaxAssignableAmount function that was preventing
the first entry from being passed when applying multiple source threads together.

The function now properly distinguishes between:
- Entries with multiple sources (uses only individualSourceAssignments)
- Entries with single source (uses only sourceThreadId)

This prevents double-counting and ensures accurate available amount calculations.
