**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Add Arkham & Etherscan attribution API integration

- Embedded Arkham API key for automatic attribution checking
- Added Etherscan label/tag checking for Ethereum addresses
- Dual-source attribution from both Arkham and Etherscan
- Attribution popup shows entity name, type, service, and source
- Works automatically for all users without configuration
- Advanced users can override with their own API keys
- Attribution data added to transaction/entry notes
- Shows source badges (üîç Arkham / üî∑ Etherscan)

Attribution now checks both services in parallel when addresses are entered,
providing comprehensive entity identification for blockchain investigations.
