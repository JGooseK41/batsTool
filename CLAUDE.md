**Commit:** 96ebc4eb84f1697559a360e69c7dd09b855c0fd2
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Major UI restructuring: Clean landing page separate from app

- Separated landing page from BATS application UI
- Landing page now shows first with only essential elements
- All app UI (tabs, tracker, action bar) hidden until user enters BATS tool
- Added showLandingPage() and showAppUI() functions for proper state management
- Modified initialization to check if user is entering app or viewing landing
- Added returnToLanding() function to allow going back from app
- Fixed welcome screen to use fixed positioning as overlay
- Cleaned up navigation flow to be more intuitive

The app now properly shows a clean landing page first with:
- Brief explanation of BATS
- Main card to enter documentation tool
- Utility tool cards (PK Converter, Address Finder, Training)
- No unnecessary tabs or UI elements visible
