# B.A.T.S. Tool - Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview
B.A.T.S. (Block Audit Tracing Standard) is a blockchain investigation tool for tracing cryptocurrency transactions across multiple chains. It helps investigators track stolen or illicit funds using a standardized notation system.

**Commit:** fd8d8fa56863b445d0920fd2b8bfe055bd9dca80
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** UX: Remove redundant confirmation popups in setup and entry phases

Removes unnecessary alert() popups that appeared after modal actions,
reducing click fatigue during investigation setup and wallet entry.

## REMOVED ALERTS:

### Setup Phase:
1. **Root Total Confirmation** (line 13315-13332)
   - Before: Alert after confirming root total
   - After: Modal closes, LIBR opens dashboard automatically
   - Reason: Modal already confirms action, alert is redundant

2. **Transaction Added** (line 16585)
   - Before: Alert "Transaction added to Victim X"
   - After: Silent - transaction appears in victim list
   - Reason: User can see it was added visually

3. **Bulk Transactions Added** (line 18068)
   - Before: Alert "Added X transactions to Victim Y"
   - After: Silent - transactions appear in list
   - Reason: Visible feedback in UI

### Wallet Entry Phase:
4. **New Thread Mode Selected** (line 18858-18860)
   - Before: Alert confirming user's choice
   - After: Modal closes immediately
   - Reason: User just chose it in modal, confirmation is redundant

5. **Addresses Clustered** (line 18945-18951)
   - Before: Alert confirming cluster creation
   - After: Modal closes, cluster visible in explorer
   - Reason: User filled out justification form, already knows

6. **LIBR Cluster Guidance** (line 19115-19125)
   - Before: Alert with LIBR aggregate balance instructions
   - After: Guidance shown in Wallet Explorer ART panel
   - Reason: Already shown in UI where user needs it

### Hop Finalization:
7. **Write-off Created** (line 22754)
   - Before: Alert "Write-off created, hop balanced"
   - After: Modal closes, hop updates visually
   - Reason: User sees hop is now balanced in UI

8. **Cold Storage Marked** (line 29091)
   - Before: Alert about wallet reclassification
   - After: Silent - visible in wallet index
   - Reason: Wallet color change shows reclassification

## KEPT ALERTS:

**Validation Errors** (kept for critical feedback):
- Missing wallet addresses
- Heuristic/justification required
- Thread selection errors
- Over-allocation errors
- Chronology errors

**Error Conditions** (kept for problem notification):
- API failures
- File loading errors
- Missing data warnings

## IMPACT:

**Before**: User clicks through 3-4 "OK" popups during setup
**After**: Modals provide feedback, user continues smoothly

**User Experience**:
âœ… Faster workflow - fewer clicks
âœ… Less interruption - actions flow naturally
âœ… Visual feedback still clear - UI updates show success
âœ… Errors still caught - validation alerts remain

## FILES MODIFIED:
- index.html:
  * Line 13315: Root total confirmation simplified
  * Line 16569: Transaction added alert removed
  * Line 18052: Bulk add alert removed
  * Line 18842: New thread choice alert removed
  * Line 18927: Clustering confirmation removed
  * Line 19087: LIBR cluster guidance removed
  * Line 22716: Write-off confirmation removed
  * Line 29089: Cold storage notification removed

## Key Features

- âœ… One-click add to existing hop
- âœ… Auto-detects correct hop from wallet
- âœ… Uses LIBR-calculated traced amount
- âœ… Auto-updates monitored proceeds
- âœ… Timestamped audit trail in notes
- âœ… Option to defer tracing decision
- âœ… **NEW:** Optional verification modal for transparency
- âœ… **NEW:** Prominent methodology selection with info modals
- âœ… Smooth navigation with visual feedback
- âœ… Maintains data integrity

## Integration with LIBR Methodology

**Proper LIBR workflow now complete:**

1. Run LIBR analysis â†’ Find drops
2. Click "Follow & Trace" â†’ Add to hop
3. Monitored amount auto-reduces
4. Re-analyze later â†’ Uses new threshold
5. Find next drops â†’ Add to same hop
6. Repeat until all traced or remains stable

**Hop 1 stays "open" and can receive entries anytime the monitored
wallet has new activity, maintaining proper LIBR accounting.**

## Files Modified

- index.html:
  * Line 35962: Updated displayLIBRAnalysisResults signature
  * Line 35959: Pass walletAddress, blockchain to display
  * Lines 36006-36023: Auto-detect target hop number
  * Lines 36032-36067: Add action buttons to each transaction

## Key Features
- **Multi-blockchain support**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and 30+ EVM chains including Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Unichain, Sonic, Abstract, Memecore, Sophon, Berachain, plus Tron, XRP, Sui, and Solana
- **4-step investigation workflow**: Setup â†’ Victims â†’ Hops â†’ Analysis
- **Thread tracking system**: Uses V-T-H notation (Victim-Transaction-Hop)
- **Real-time validation**: Validates traced amounts against ART (Available Running Total)
- **Wallet entity detection**: Identifies known exchanges and services
- **Export capabilities**: Multiple formats for investigation reports
- **Undo system**: Supports up to 20 undo states
- **Auto-save functionality**: File system integration

## Current State
- Main functionality is working
- Flow diagram visualization is next priority (Phase 1 started but needs implementation)
- UI recently improved for multi-transfer handling
- Validation system fixed and operational

## Technical Notes
- Single-file application in `index.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with no build process
- Includes embedded styles and scripts
- Supports file operations through browser File API

## API Integration Status

### Available APIs
- **Mempool.space** (FREE): Transaction lookups, address validation, fee estimates
  - Note: Website has excellent autocomplete, API has backend support but endpoint not fully documented
- **Blockchain.info** (FREE): Bitcoin addresses and transactions
- **BlockCypher** (FREE limited): Multi-chain support with rate limits
- **Arkham Intelligence** (API key): Best for Bitcoin attribution and entity identification
- **Etherscan** (API key): EVM chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
- **TronGrid** (API key): Tron blockchain

### Address Search Strategy
The address search tool uses multiple fallback strategies:
1. Mempool.space (experimental endpoints for prefix search)
2. Arkham Intelligence (best for attribution and partial matches)
3. Complete address validation (Mempool, Blockchain.info)
4. BlockCypher (if API key available)
5. Known address database (major exchanges)

## Next Steps
- Complete flow diagram visualization implementation
- Enhance multi-transfer selection UI
- Consider adding more blockchain support
- Investigate Mempool.space undocumented search endpoints

## Implementation Plan - Core Behavior Fixes

### Phase 1: Thread Management & Allocation
1. âœ… Implement PIFO (Proceeds In First Out) allocation
   - Auto-allocate using V1-T1 before V2-T1, etc.
   - Document allocation in entry notes
   - Allow manual override for matching specific transactions

2. â¬œ Fix change address handling
   - Funds returning to sender address stay in original thread
   - Don't create new hop for change outputs
   - Properly detect change vs. payment outputs

3. â¬œ Implement allocation validation
   - Hard block if total allocation exceeds available threads
   - Allow partial tracing (trace portion of larger transaction)
   - Validate before entry creation

### Phase 2: Notation & Display
4. â¬œ Update commingling notation format
   - Use parentheses: `(V1-T1) (V2-T1) H2`
   - Multiple transactions: `(V1-T2,3) (V2-T1,2,4) H3`
   - Keep notation unchanged through swaps

5. â¬œ Make thread review modal optional
   - Add setting to disable/enable
   - Only show if warnings/issues detected
   - Remove automatic popup on hop completion

### Phase 3: Validation & Constraints
6. â¬œ Enforce victim completion workflow
   - Require completion before adding new victim
   - Allow reopening before root total generation
   - Maintain green summary view for completed victims

7. â¬œ Update write-off behavior
   - Reduce ART (Adjusted Root Total) on hop close
   - Not immediately on entry
   - Track write-offs separately in totals

### Phase 4: Transaction Handling
8. â¬œ Fix ERC-20/gas fee handling
   - Ignore ETH gas unless ETH is source thread
   - Filter by tracked currency only
   - No multi-output selection for single token transfers

9. â¬œ Manual entry flexibility
   - Don't require transaction hash for off-chain
   - Allow CEX internal transfers
   - Support incomplete transaction data

### Testing Scenarios
- Simple linear flow (1 victim â†’ 3 hops)
- Commingling (multiple victims â†’ merged hop)
- Split threads (one thread â†’ multiple outputs)
- DEX swaps (currency conversion)
- Complex combination flows
