**Message:** Revert PINK wallet to flower emoji - no pink circle exists

- Change back from pink heart (ðŸ©·) to flower (ðŸŒ¸)
- The flower emoji is actually meaningful for 'Dividend/Deception' wallets
- No standard pink circle emoji exists in Unicode
- Flower represents the deceptive 'blooming returns' in investment scams
