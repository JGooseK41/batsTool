**Commit:** 2ccef07bbbff89a85ae0eab8e9f36e52a219393a
**Author:** Your Name
**Message:** Improve hop progression clarity and finalization UX

- Add comprehensive hop finalization summary showing balance status and threads created
- Show clear "Hop is Balanced" or "Unaccounted Amounts" status with visual indicators
- Display threads created in current hop that will be available for next hop
- Improve "Add New Hop" button to show next hop number and available ART amounts
- Fix button states to clearly indicate when hops must be completed first
- Make finalization modal always appear, even when balanced, for better user understanding
- Add explanatory text that wallet classification options are only for balancing unaccounted funds

These changes address user confusion about hop progression and make it clear when balancing is needed vs optional.
